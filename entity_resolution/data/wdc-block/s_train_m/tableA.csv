2,Corsair,Corsair Carbide SPEC-01 Tower Black,"The essential gaming PC case.Carbide Series SPEC-01 is proof that great looks, smart design, and durable construction don’t need to be pricy, and that basic doesn’t need to be boring. You get aggressive styling, a huge side panel window for admiring your components, and an LED-lit front intake fan that draws cool air directly to your graphics cards.Inside, there’s room for up to five fans, and the four combination hard drive / SSD trays make storage installation and upgrades quick and easy. Cable routing cutouts help you reduce clutter, and the built-in dust filters help protect your components. Up front, the USB 3.0 connector gets you up to speed with the latest high-performance storage devices.Huge side panel windowThe aggressive look of the SPEC-01 makes it look great on the outside, but there’s beauty on the inside of a well-built system, too. The large side panel window lets you show it off.LED front intake fan, with room for moreThe 120mm front intake fan is bathed in soft LED lighting, and it’s oriented to draw cool air directly across your graphics cards. And if you want even more ventilation, you can add a second 120mm fan or even dual 140mm fans.Flexible cooling potentialLike all Corsair cases, the SPEC-01 is designed for cooling, so you’re covered if you’re overclocking, running multiple GPUs, or if you just want more airflow. There are mounting points for up to five fans, including dual front 140mm or 120mm fans, dual 120mm fans on top, and a rear 120mm fan.Multiple drive baysYou might not build a system with four hard drives or SSDs, but with SPEC-01, you can if you want. In addition to the two standard 5.25” optical drive bays, there are four built-in 3.5” / 2.5” combo drive bays for mechanical hard drives or solid-state drives.Easy system builds, maintenance and upgradesBuilds should be easy, no matter what your budget. 3.5” drive installation is tool-free, and you get cable routing holes for neater-looking builds and better airflow. And, there’s a CPU cutout to allow for cooling upgrades without removing the motherboard. The front intake fan filters help keep dust out of the interior, and the front panel has a USB 3.0 port for fast performance from USB flash drives and portable hard drives.Contents and SpecificationsPackage contentsCarbide Series SPEC-01 Mid-Tower Gaming CaseAccessories box with screws, zip ties, and other mounting hardwareWarranty and Support InformationCompatibilityMini ITX, Micro ATX, ATX motherboardsTechnical specificationsTons of fan mounts:Front – 2 x 140/120mm (1 x 120mm LED included)Top – 2 x 120mmRear – 120mmUSB 3.0 front port with internal connectorLarge side panel windowWarrantyTwo yearsWeight4.8kgColorBlackCase Form FactorMid-towerDimensions479mm x 200mm x 430mmCase Motherboard SupportMini ITX, Micro ATX, ATXMaximum GPU Length414mmMaximum CPU Cooler Height150mmMaximum PSU Length230mmCase Expansion Slots7Case Drive Bays(x2) 5.25in(x4) Combo 3.5in/ 2.5inCase MaterialSteelCase Power SupplyATX (not included)External Connections(x1) USB 2.0 (x1) USB 3.0 (x1) Headphone Port (x1) Microphone PortFan Mount LocationsFront: (x2) 120/140mm Top: (x2) 120mmRear: (x1) 120mmFans IncludedFront: (x1) 120mmRadiator Mount LocationsRear: 120mmCompatible Corsair Liquid CoolersH55, H60, H75, H80 Cable routing and CPU cooler backplate motherboard cutoutsSeven PCIe slots with room for long graphics cards up to 420mm longInstall up to four storage drives, your choice of 3.5” or 2.5”, each tray fits bothDust filters for front and PSU intake",79,2,,

(66 mm by 30 mm)In short, 204-pin small outline dual inline memory modules (SODIMMs) are the form factor used to provide DDR3 memory modules for notebook computers and other small form factor computing platforms. 204-pin SODIMMs are currently available in PC3-8500 (DDR3 1066MHz) and PC3-10600 (DDR3 1333MHz) speeds.To use DDR3 memory, your system must have both a 204-pin SODIMM slot and a chipset that supports DDR3 memory. A DDR3 SODIMM will not fit into DDR2 or DDR memory sockets. (Information about which memory technology your system uses is included in the Crucial Memory Advisor™ tool.)SODIMMs are smaller and thinner than regular DIMMs, and the 204-pin SODIMM PCBs are always ~2.6 inches long and are usually around 1.18 inches high (though the heights can vary slightly). They consist of a number of memory components (usually black) that are attached to a printed circuit board (usually green). The number of memory components on a 204-pin SODIMM’s printed circuit board (PCB) can vary, but the PCB will always have 102 pins on the front and the back both, for a total of 204 pins. The gold pins on the bottom of the SODIMM provide the connection between the memory module and the memory socket.ECC: NON-ECCKit Qty: 1Speed: 1600 MT/STracer: FalseVoltage: 1.35VDIMM Type: UnbufferedBullet Features: Increases system performance",1026.00,21,,

Supporting NTSC/PAL/HD and Ultra HD video formats, the switcher connects to a wide range of cameras and sources, delivering a single program stream in SD, HD, or Ultra HD video. All this is done live and in real time with no rendering required. The switcher features a reference video input for synchronizing the switcher to other equipment using tri-level or blackburst sync. Each input also features its own frame synchronizer, which allows you to use cameras that do not feature Genlock as well as input video from computer sources.The switcher provides 8 video outputs that are always active. It features two SDI and one HDMI Program output, both of which deliver SD/HD/Ultra HD, with one aux SD/HD/Ultra HD output that can deliver a clean program feed without any downstream effects. The switcher also features a down-converted HD output for monitoring on an SDI-equipped HD monitor. Multi view monitoring is 1080i only, over dedicated SDI or HDMI output, and multi view allows you to view the program, preview, and eight live sources at the same time. The switcher features built-in luma and chroma keyers for real time effects and composites in Ultra HD, with 10-bit processing. Two downstream keyers allow you to use two graphics/logos/titles/lower thirds from up to twenty stored graphics in a wide variety of formats.A built-in twelve-channel audio mixer handles the embedded HDMI and SDI audio from the 10 active video inputs as well as audio from the balanced or unbalanced analog audio inputs to provide you flexibility and creative audio options. Audio output is embedded in the SDI and HDMI stream, as well as available via balanced audio outputs. Either a Mac or PC running the included ATEM Software controls the switcher's operation and settings. For those who like the feel of a physical control panel, available ATEM ME 1 and ME 2 Broadcast Panels, connected via the Ethernet port, also control all the features of the switcher. Illuminated front panel buttons allow you to locally select the aux output, while a 2-inch LCD screen built into the front of the unit allows you to see the aux output for instant confirmation of the correct output.The ATEM 1 M/E Production Studio 4K switcher supports 4K Ultra HD video (3840 x 2160), which is four times the resolution of Full HD. The video format is set by the user and must be the same across each input, as the switcher cannot scale different input formats to match the project format.The switcher features ten single link 6G-SDI and one HDMI 4K input, which allows you to connect SD/HD/Ultra HD and computer-based signal to the switcher. However, the HDMI input is shared with one of the SDI inputs, so you can only have a maximum of ten inputs.The switcher takes reference video in for sync timing, either blackburst or tri-level sync, so that it can interface with other post production equipment.Each input incorporates its own frame synchronizer, which enables you to use cameras that do not have genlock capability or to input computer sources such as Keynote or PowerPoint Presentations.The switcher includes a built-in 12 channel audio mixer that lets you manually mix sources or you can set mixer inputs to \""audio follow video\"" so your audio crossfades as you switch between sources.The switcher features two program outputs for the final video, delivering SD/HD/Ultra HD via two 6G-SDI port and one HDMI 4K connector.Multi view output is available via an SDI or HDMI connector.The switcher features an SDI aux output that is capable of delivering the program out feed with or without the downstream keyer effects in SD, HD and Ultra HD. Control of the Aux output is by front mounted panel buttons, and built-in 2-inch LCD screen for immediate confirmation of the Aux output.Multi View MonitoringThe Multi view output features four selectable screen layouts that show eight inputs or six inputs and the two internal media players, plus Preview and Program outputs, on one screen at the same time.TransitionsThe ATEM 1 M/E Production Studio 4K switcher features four built-in transitions.Cut: ATEM instantly changes from current program source to the preview source precisely at the moment you hit the button. Cuts can be performed by directly selecting sources on the program bus or more commonly by pressing the cut button to transition to the next source lined up on the preview bus.Mix: Dissolves from one image to another. You can program a pre-set transition rate, or use the included software control panel or available hardware panels to manually transition from one shot to another.Dip: Is similar to the mix/dissolve, except it first it transitions to a color/graphic or video source and then to the next shot.Wipe patterns: With 18 built-in wipe patterns, you can create over 100 differnet transitions, and the patterns can be inverted or softened and you can customize the color of the border. You can also insert up to three live video streams into the borders.Key Frameable TransitionsThe built-in DVE allows you to create key frame based DVE moves, flying graphics and animated stingers.The switcher features four upstream keyers and a DVE, alowing you to layer live video, title, graphics and animation over live video. You can choose from chroma, luma, linear, and pattern keys at Ultra HD resolution with 10-bit processing.Two downstream keyers allow you to add graphics, lower thirds, titles and logos for a polished live production.The DVE allows you to create a picture-in-picture effect.The switcher features back lit Front panel control buttons for manual control.The ATEM 4K switcher uses an Ethernet connection to interface with control surfaces such as the optional ATEM 1 M/E and 2 M/E Broadcast Panels.You can also control the switcher by using the included ATEM Software Control software from a Mac or Windows computer over Ethernet. You can control all production settings of the switcher as well as directly import graphics from your computer into the switcher's media pool.You set the format for each project you are working on, from SD to HD to Ultra HD, selecting resolution and frame rate. This is accomplished by using either the included software for Mac/PC, or via the ATEM 1 M/E or ATEM 2 M/E Broadcast Panel.Using the Ethernet port on the switcher allows you to connect control surfaces directly to the switcher or you can control the switcher across a network.The switcher features a USB port that is used for software updates and to set the switcher's chassis IP address, which can only be done by using a computer running the ATEM Switcher Utility connected to the switcher's USB port.The switcher is a single RU in height and has built-in rack mount ears, for mounting in a production road case or in a post production facility.Ultra HD SupportSDI3840 x 2160p 23.98/24/2529.97/30HDMI: Computer Input Resolutions3840 x 2160 23.98/24/25/29.97 HzHD Format SupportSDI720p 50/59.941080i 50/59.941080p 23.98/24/25/29.97/50/59.94HDMI: Computer Input Resolutions1280 x 720 50/59.94 Hz1920 x 1080 50/59.94 HzSD Format SupportSDINTSC: 525/29.97 - 4:3/16:9PAL: 625/25 - 4:3/16:9HDMI: Computer Input Resolutions720 x 480i 59.94 Hz720 x 576i 50HzSDI ComplianceSMPTE 259M, 292MVideo Inputs10 x SDI (10-bit SD/HD/Ultra HD switchable)1 x HDMI 4K(10-bit SD/HD/Ultra HD switchable)2 Channel embedded audioAudio InputDigital20 x Embedded audio via SDI or HDMIAnalog2 x XLR2 x RCASync Input1 x SDI: Tri-Sync or BlackburstFrame Synchronizer 10 x Internal frame synchronizers (all inputs)Program Output2 x SDI (10-bit SD/HD/Ultra HD 4K switchable) 1 x HDMI Type A (10-bit SD/HD/Ultra HD 4K switchable)1 x SDI (Ultra HD 4K to HD only)Auxiliary Output3 x SDI (10-bit SD/HD/Ultra HD 4K switchable)Multi View Output1 x SDI (HD-SDI)1 x HDMI (HD)Preview (PVW) Output1 x SDI (10-bit SD/HD/Ultra HD 4K switchable)Multi View Output1 x SDI1 x HDMISDI Audio Output2 Channels embedded into SDI outputAnalog Audio Output2 x XLREthernet1 x 10/100/1000 BaseT input.

In addition to consistently superior image quality at all focal lengths it provides a versatile zoom range in a compact lens that can bring out the very best in 7 series bodies for a wide range of subjects.Refined optics deliver stunning imagesFive aspherical elements and one ED glass element in a state-of-the-art optical path suppress aberration for outstanding clarity and beautiful rendering throughout the range. The acclaimed ZEISS T* coating controls reflections for superior contrast, and a circular aperture contributes to smooth background bokeh with natural highlights.Constant exposure at any zoom settingConstant F4 aperture at all focal lengths means that the user can zoom and shoot at any aperture without having to worry about changes in exposure settings or depth of field, concentrating on the image rather than technical details.Always sharp and clearBuilt-in Optical SteadyShot image stabilization compensates for camera shake that can blur images when shooting handheld. Sharp, clear night scenes or indoor shots in dim lighting can be captured without the need to boost ISO sensitivity and risk increased noise.Outstanding colour and contrastThe ZEISS T* coating is an important contributing factor, effectively suppressing spurious reflections that can degrade overall image quality. Flare and ghosting are reduced for enhanced colour and contrast that give images a deep, three-dimensional feel.Extra-low Dispersion Glass elementLenses constructed with conventional optical glass struggle with chromatic aberration as the focal length increases. Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass counters these issues, delivering superior contrast and colour quality across the entire focal length – even at large aperture settings.7-bladed circular apertureThe 7-blade circular makes it possible to achieve smoother, more natural defocusing in your images. Get creative with artistic blurring or 'bokeh' – and greater control over the depth of field.Reliable and easy in any conditionsReliable operation in a variety of conditions is ensured by a design that prevents dust and moisture from entering the lens.",699,252,,

This fourth edition of the a7R sees the inclusion of an updated 61MP Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor and enhanced BIONZ X image processor, which afford impressive imaging results with marked smoothness, a 15-stop dynamic range, and, of course, speed. Up to 10 fps shooting is possible along with the ability to record UHD 4K30 video, both with support for Real-time Eye AF and Tracking AF technologies. The revised sensor design uses a Fast Hybrid AF System, with 567 phase-detection autofocus points, for notably fast and accurate focusing performance. Despite being such a high-resolution sensor, it is also distinguished by its flexible native sensitivity range from ISO 100-32000 for working in a variety of lighting conditions. Additionally, benefitting both stills and video operation, the a7R IV retains the 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift image stabilization, which is effective to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to 5.5 stops.

459,,Sony Alpha a9 II Mirrorless Digital Camera Body,"The second generation of speed, theSony Alpha a9 IItakes the impressive feature-set of its predecessor and adds enhanced connectivity, a refined body design, and even quicker performance. Utilizing the proven 24.2MP full-frame Exmor RS BSI stacked CMOS sensor and an updated BIONZ X processor, the a9 II sports especially quick and responsive capabilities. Up to 20 fps shooting is possible with a silent electronic shutter or up to 10 fps with a mechanical shutter is supported, along with a wide sensitivity range that reaches up to an expanded ISO 204800. The sensor's design also incorporates a 693-point phase-detection autofocus system, which offers intelligent subject tracking and Real-time Eye AF to ensure critical focus on moving subjects. The BIONZ X also performs up to 60 AF/AE functions per second to go along with the 20 fps shooting for reliable results in quickly changing situations. In addition to stills, UHD 4K video recording is supported at up to 30 fps and Quick and Slow Motion recording is also available. Additionally, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift image stabilization is available, too, which minimizes the appearance of camera shake by up to 5.5 stops.Benefitting the imaging capabilities, the a9 II receives a dramatic update in its physical design, featuring a more ergonomic body shape, refined weather sealing, and improved connectivity. A 3.69m-dot OLED EVF provides a bright, clear eye-level viewing means and affords blackout-free viewing to support photographing at high continuous speeds. The rear 3.0\"" 1.44m-dot tilting LCD has a touchscreen design, too, for intuitive control over shooting settings and playback. Dual UHS-II SD memory card slots permit flexible file storage and the a9 II has been fitted with an improved 1000BASE-T Ethernet port for faster wired LAN sharing and remote camera operation. 5.0 GHz wireless sharing and Bluetooth are integrated, as well, for wireless sharing and remote camera control. Additionally, Voice Memos enables you to record up to 60-second sound clips with each photo, which can then be automatically converted to text, using the Transfer & Tagging app add-on, and then embedded into files' metadata.24.2MP Exmor RS BSI Stacked CMOS Sensor and BIONZ X Image ProcessorBuilt for speed, the a9 II utilizes a 24.2MP Exmor RS BSI stacked CMOS sensor, along with an updated BIONZ X image processor, that yields impressively quick and responsive performance. Up to 20 fps continuous shooting is possible using an electronic shutter or 10 fps shooting is supported with a mechanical shutter. The sensor's back-illuminated design also affords high sensitivity to an extended ISO 204800 with reduced noise for clean image quality in a variety of lighting conditions. Additionally, uncompressed raw files can be recorded in 14-bit for greater color fidelity and post-production flexibility.The BIONZ X processor also works in conjunction with a high-speed front-end LSI to realize faster processing times along with a wide dynamic range with smooth tonal rendering. Benefitting the fast recording capabilities is an equally quick AF/AE metering system that functions at 60 times per second to continuously evaluate the scene in order to lock onto and track moving subjects. Automatic anti-flicker shooting also recognizes and times the shutter action to minimize the flicker effect for more consistent results on still images. Additionally, due to the use of an electronic shutter, totally blackout-free monitoring is possible with the electronic viewfinder for more accurate compositions of moving subjects.Fast Hybrid AF SystemCovering 93% of the image area, a Fast Hybrid AF system incorporates 693 phase-detection points along with 425 contrast-detection areas for quick and precise focusing in a variety of lighting conditions with sensitivity down to -3 EV. The density of focusing points from this hybrid AF system also enables High-density Tracking AF Technology, which is adept at tracking moving subjects in a variety of lighting conditions. Updated AF algorithms also benefit maintaining critical focus on erratically or unpredictably moving subjects. Additionally, the use of phase-detection points enables the use of A-mount lenses via the optional LA-EA3 or LA-EA1 lens mount adapters with full continuous AF/AE tracking compatibility.The apt focus system also lends itself to a variety of focusing functions for refined accuracy, including Lock-on AF, which maintains focus on moving subjects throughout the use of a configurable frame that is set over the desired moving subject, and Expand Flexible Spot, which employs neighboring focus points to retain focus on moving subjects even if the originally selected point loses focus. The focus frame color is selectable, between white and red, and AF tracking is possible with apertures narrower than f/16 with select lenses when working in Focus Priority mode. Additionally, Eye AF can be used to base focus on recognized human subjects' eyes for portraits and is available in both AF-S and AF-C modes, for both stills and video. Eye AF can be used when photographing animal subjects, too, with any focusing mode when shooting stills. Autofocus can also be used in conjunction with the Focus Magnifier function for critical focus when homing in on minute subject details. The rear touchscreen can also be used for Touch Focus control, and a Touchpad Focus Control mode lets you use the rear screen intuitively while keeping your eye to the viewfinder. Additionally, when working in AF-C mode, the focus point can be moved while the shutter button is half-pressed, making it easier to quickly shift focus without losing sight of the action.Body DesignA Quad-VGA OLED Tru-Finder EVF is featured and has a 3.69m-dot resolution and 0.78x-magnification for bright, clear viewing in rich detail, and a dedicated High Quality setting enables a 120 fps refresh rate for especially smooth playback of moving subjects. Additionally, a fluorine coating has been applied to the outermost viewfinder element to benefit cleaning.In addition to the EVF, a 3.0\"" 1.44m-dot rear LCD is also available, which has a touch panel design for intuitive operation and focusing control. The screen also tilts upward and downward to benefit working from high and low angles.Magnesium alloy chassis assures rigidity, durability, and stability while remaining lightweight. The lens mount has also been improved to better support heavy lenses, and the grip rigidity has been improved for more comfortable hand-holding.Extensive weather-sealing, including enhanced sealing around the battery cover, terminal cover, and chassis joints, has been employed to resist dust and moisture for reliable operation in harsh weather conditions.Using the same NP-FZ100 battery as its predecessor, the a9 II's battery life is rated for approximately 500 shots per charge with the EVF or 690 shots with the rear LCD.Dual SD memory card slots allow for flexible file saving and handling and can be configured to partition raw and JPEG files or can be used for overflow recording. Both of the card slots are rated to support UHS-II memory cards for faster transfer speeds.A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port has been added, in addition to a micro-USB port, for faster, more reliable tethering support. The USB Type-C connection allows the camera to be charged from the host power source while connected.Integrated PC sync terminal for wired flash sync with strobe packs or wireless radio remotes.Durable shutter design has been tested for 500,000 actuations.Updated Multi Interface Shoe supports working with the optional ECM-B1M Shotgun Microphone or XLR-K3M XLR Adapter Kit, which provide improved, clear audio recording sound by sending a digital audio signal to the camera, opposed to an analog signal.The a9 II also features a 3.5mm microphone input jack for compatibility with external microphones.Compatible with optional VG-C4EM Vertical Grip.ConnectivityBuilt-in Wi-Fi enables the a9 II to instantly share imagery to mobile devices for direct sharing online, and support for both 2.4 and 5.0 GHz bands also enables wireless tethered shooting support.

A constant f/4 aperture makes operation smooth and consistent throughout the zoom range. The lens further benefits from the use of one extra-low dispersion element and five aspherical elements to combat aberrations as well as a Zeiss T* anti-reflective coating to keep flare and ghosting to an absolute minimum. The lens is fast to focus as well due to the linear autofocus motor and an internal focus design. Additionally, the dust- and moisture-resistant lens is equipped with Optical SteadyShot image stabilization to reduce the effects of camera shake, and it has a seven-blade circular diaphragm for smooth bokeh.Based on the Zeiss Tessar optical concept, this lens uses a design with 12 elements in ten groups that helps ensure a smaller overall lens size along with reduced flaring, distortion, and chromatic aberrations.Covering wide-angle to short telephoto perspectives, this compact 24-70mm can quickly become a go-to lens for Sony's full-frame E-mount cameras. It can also be used on APS-C format cameras where it will provide a 36-105mm equivalent zoom range.A constant f/4 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and also lends greater control over focus position for shallow depth of field techniques.Zeiss T* anti-reflective coatings have been applied to each lens surface to help minimize reflections in order to provide greater image clarity, contrast, and color fidelity.One extra-low dispersion glass element is featured in the lens design to help reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing for improved clarity and color neutrality.Five aspherical elements are incorporated in the lens design to reduce astigmatism, field curvature, coma, and other monochromatic aberrations.Optical SteadyShot image stabilization helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper imagery when shooting handheld with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization system can also be combined with select camera's sensor-shift type image stabilization for more effective control of camera blur.A linear autofocus motor and internal focus design provide quick and precise autofocus performance and enables accurate and silent focusing while recording videos.Dust- and moisture-sealed design better permits working in inclement conditions and rubberized control rings benefit handling in colder temperatures.Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality when employing selective focus techniques.In the Box",798.00,449,,

494,,Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with PQQ,"CoQ10 is required to convert fats and sugars into usable cellular energy. And our Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with PQQ contains three key nutrients to boost energy production at the cellular level:super-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit, and PQQ. The cellular energy support these nutrients provide benefits your heart, brain, kidneys … and all the other cells in your body which require high levels of energy to function properly.Benefits at a GlanceContains the better-absorbed ubiquinol form of CoQ10Ubiquinol CoQ10 stays in the bloodstream longerShilajit doubles CoQ10 levels in the mitochondriaPQQ nutrient promotes the generation of new mitochondriaUbiquinol form of CoQ10Studies show that absorption of the ubiquinol form of CoQ10 is far greater than the conventional ubiquinone form. In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was shown to be 40% more effective in slowing measurements of aging, compared to ubiquinone.5 Life Extension® offers this highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of patented CoQ10 in an advanced delivery system, providing an unparalleled absorption level.6Enhanced Support with ShilajitPrimaVie® shilajit is a nutrient that has been shown to double levels of CoQ10 in mitochondria.7 Combining CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. And in muscle cells there was a 144% increase in energy production—27% better than CoQ10 alone.8Shilajit stabilizes CoQ10 in its superior ubiquinol form.9,10 Shilajit also facilitates more efficient delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria, which results in greater cellular energy production.11-14 Plus, shilajit itself is rich in compounds that help the mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the body's main source of energy.12PQQ Promotes Growth of New MitochondriaPQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone) is a nutrient that promotes the production of new mitochondria.15 In fact, PQQ promotes youthful cellular function in three distinct ways:Promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. PQQ activates genes that promote the formation of fresh mitochondria.15 It also beneficially interacts with genes directly involved in mitochondrial health. These same genes support healthy body weight, normal fat and sugar metabolism and youthful cellular proliferation.16Mitochondrial defense. Mitochondria possess their own DNA, distinct from those contained in the cell nucleus. Unfortunately, compared to nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA are relatively unprotected—and yet situated at the source of both energy and free-radical production. PQQ's antioxidant potency and favorable gene-expression profile act to support mitochondrial defense.Antioxidant power. PQQ is a potent antioxidant. Its extraordinary molecular stability enables it to facilitate thousands of antioxidant reactions in the mitochondria—without breaking down—for maximum antioxidant and bioenergetic support.17Research demonstrates that PQQs unique nutritional profile supports heart health and brain function — alone, and especially in combination with CoQ10.18-20 The optimal dose of PQQ is 20 mg each day. Customers taking Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer, Mitochondrial Basics, or PQQ 10 mg caps obtain this optimal PQQ dose when taking Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with PQQ.

Since the adjacent fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.UNIQUE BLADE FANThe airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing the airflow.3D ACTIVE FANThe 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle.HEAT PIPE DIRECT TOUCH GPUThe shape of the pure copper heat pipe maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU, enhancing heat transfer. The heat pipe also covers the VRAM through a large metal plate contact to ensure proper cooling.COMPOSITE HEAT-PIPEThe composite heat-pipe combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently manage the heat transfer between two solid interfaces which increases cooling capacity.EXTREME DURABILITY AND OVERCLOCKINGThe graphics card uses the 4+2 power phase design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature, and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET, plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors, to provide excellent performance and longer system life.(Reference card is 3+1 power phase)PROTECTION BACK PLATEThe back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.IN TOTAL COMMANDThe actual software UI and functionalities depend on each device model.",18999.00,475,,

In regard to the optical design, a unique aspherical extra-low dispersion element, in addition to three aspherical elements, is used to help reduce chromatic aberrations and distortions throughout the zoom range in order to achieve high image sharpness and clarity. Both Nano Crystal and Super Integrated Coatings have also been applied to control flare and ghosting for greater contrast and color rendering in bright and backlit conditions.Complementing the optics, a stepping motor provides quick, quiet, and precise autofocus performance along with full-time manual focus override to suit both stills and video applications. A programmable control ring can be set for intuitive adjustment over a variety of camera and exposure settings.

768,,Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™,"Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy. Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie® shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain,2 liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.3,4CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage.1 Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.Ratings based on results of the 2019 ConsumerLab.com Survey of Supplement Users. www.consumerlab.com/survey2019.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingUbiquinol (as Kaneka Ubiquinol™)50 mgPrimaVie® Shilajit fulvic acid complex50 mgOther ingredients: sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, beeswax, sunflower lecithin, annatto color.Non-GMOPrimaVie® is a registered trademark of Natreon, Inc.Q+®, Kaneka Ubiquinol™, and the quality seal™ are registered or pending trademarks of Kaneka Corp.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.WarningsKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSEDo not purchase if outer seal is broken or damaged.When using nutritional supplements, please consult with your physician if you are undergoing treatment for a medical condition or if you are pregnant or lactating.To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-866-280-2852.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.This product is not for use by or sale to persons under the age of 18.

Sync InputTheBlackmagic ATEM Production Studio 4K Live Switcheris a live event multi camera production switcher with 8 individual Ultra HD inputs built into a 1RU chassis. Supporting NTSC/PAL/HD and Ultra HD video formats via Four Single Link 6G-SDI and Four 4K HDMI inputs, the switcher connects to a wide range of cameras and sources, delivering a single program stream in SD, HD, or Ultra HD video. All this is done live and in real time with no rendering required.The switcher features a reference video input for synchronizing the switcher to other equipment using Tri-level or Blackburst Sync. Each input also features its own frame synchronizer, which allows you to use cameras that do not feature Genlock as well as input video from computer sources. The switcher can handle inputs from all inputs at the same time.The switcher provides six video outputs that are always active. Featuring one SDI and one HDMI Program output , both of which deliver SD/HD/Ultra HD, with one Aux SD/HD/Ultra HD Output that can deliver a clean Program feed without any downstream effects, as primary outputs. The switcher also features an HD only Program output signal for monitoring on an SDI-equipped HD monitor. Multiview monitoring is also HD only over dedicated SDI or HDMI output, and Multiview allows you to view the Program, Preview, six active inputs and two graphic channels (media players) on one screen at the same time. The switcher features a built-in compliment of one Upstream and two Downstream keyers for real time effects and composites in Ultra HD, with 10-bit processing. The two downstream keyers allow you to use two graphics/logos/titles/lower thirds from up to twenty stored graphics in a wide variety of formats.A built-in two channel audio mixer handles the embedded HDMI and SDI audio from the six active video inputs as well as audio from the balanced and unbalanced analog audio inputs to provide you flexibility and creative audio options. Audio output is embedded in the SDI and HDMI stream, as well as available via balanced audio outputs. Either a Mac or PC running the included ATEM Software controls the switcher's operation and settings. For those who like the feel of a physical control panel, available ATEM Broadcast Panels, connected via the Ethernet port, also control all the features of the switcher. Illuminated front panel buttons allow you to locally select the Aux output, while a two inch LCD screen built into the front of the unit allows you to see the Aux output for instant confirmation of the correct output.VideoThe ATEM Production Studio Live 4K Switcher supports 4K Ultra HD video (3840 x 2160), which is four times the resolution of Full HD. It has eight video inputs, all of which can be active simultaneously.The switcher features four single link 6G-SDI and four HDMI 4K inputs, which allows you to connect SD/HD/Ultra HD and computer-based signal to the switcher. Although the switcher takes reference video in for sync timing so that it can interface with other post production equipment, each input has its own Frame synchronizer, which enables you to use cameras that do not have genlock capability or for input of computer sources such as Keynote or PowerPoint PresentationsThe capture video format is set by the user, and must be the same across each input, as the switcher cannot scale different input formats to match the project format.AudioThe switcher includes a built-in audio mixer that allows you to adjust the audio embedded in the SDI and HDMI signals. With 10 inputs available the 2 channel mixer can also adjust levels of both the balanced and unbalanced analog inputs.6 Video OutputsThe switcher features 3 program outputs for the final video, delivering SD/HD/Ultra HD via both a 6G-SDI port and HDMI 4K connector. The third program output is an HD-SDI only port (Ultra HD is automatically down-converted).Two Multi-view outputs allow you to see Program, Preview, the 6 live inputs and the two graphic channels on one screen at the same time. There is 1 SDI and 1 HDMI connector which feeds the Multi-view output to HD monitors.The switcher features an SDI Aux output that is capable of delivering the Program out feed with or without the downstream keyer effects in SD, HD and Ultra HD. Control of the Aux output is by front mounted panel buttons, and built-in 2-inch LCD screen for immediate confirmation of the Aux output.Multi View MonitoringMulti view allows you to view the program, preview, 6 live inputs and 2 media players side by side. You can also add custom labels that make it easy to identify each input.EffectsThe switcher features an upstream keyer that includes independent chroma, pattern, shaped and luma keying all at Ultra HD resolution with 10-bit processing. Two downstream keyers allow you to add graphics, lower thirds, titles and logos for a polished live production.Control InterfaceThe ATEM 4K switcher uses an Ethernet connection to interface with control surfaces such as the optional ATEM 1 M/E and 2 M/E Broadcast Panels.You can also control the switcher by using the included ATEM Software Control software from a Mac or Windows computer over Ethernet. You can control all production settings of the switcher as well as directly import graphics from your computer into the switcher's media pool.You set the format for each project you are working on, from SD to HD to Ultra HD, selecting resolution and frame rate. This is accomplished by using either the included software for Mac/PC, or via the ATEM 1 M/E or ATEM 2 M/E Broadcast Panel.Using the Ethernet port on the switcher allows you to connect control surfaces directly to the switcher or you can control the switcher across a network.The Switcher features a mini USB port that is used for software updates and to set the switcher's Chassis IP address, which can only be done by using a computer running the ATEM Switcher Utility connected to the switcher's USB port.Rack MountThe switcher is a single RU in height and has built-in rack mount ears, for mounting in a production road case or in a post production facility.In the BoxBlackmagic Design ATEM Production Studio 4K Live SwitcherSoftware SD CardLimited 1-Year Warranty",1695.00,724,,

829,,Life Extension - Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support 50mg - 30 softgels,"DescriptionSuper Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy.Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone. In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That's why we've created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.",20.15,728,,

839,Gigabyte,"GIGABYTE VGA AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT OC 8G, 8GB GDDR6, 1xHDMI, 3xDP","Radeon RX 5500 XT OC 8G FeaturesPowered by AMD Radeon™ RX 5500 XT Integrated with 8GB GDDR6 128-bit memory interface WINDFORCE 2X Cooling System with alternate spinning fans Protection Back Plate PCI-Express 4.0 SupportCore ClockBoost Clock: up to 1845 MHz Game Clock*: 1733 MHz (Reference card is 1717 MHz) Base Clock: 1647 MHz (Reference card is 1607 MHz)* “Game Clock” is the expected GPU clock when running typical gaming applications, set to typical TGP (Total Graphics Power). Actual individual game clock results may vary.WINDFORCE 2X COOLING SYSTEMThe WINDFORCE 2X cooling system features 2x 90mm unique blade fans, alternate spinning fan, 3 composite copper heat pipes, heat-pipe direct touch and 3D active fan functionality, together delivering an effective heat dissipation capacity for higher performance at lower temperatures. ALTERNATE SPINNINGThe GIGABYTE “Alternate Spinning” is the only solution that can solve the turbulent airflow of three fans. The biggest problem with the three fans is turbulence. Since the fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the middle fan in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure. UNIQUE BLADE FANThe airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing the airflow. 3D ACTIVE FANThe 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle. HEAT PIPEs DIRECT TOUCH GPUThe shape of the pure copper heat pipes maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU, enhancing heat transfer. The heat pipes also cover the VRAM through a large metal plate contact to ensure proper cooling. COMPOSITE HEAT-PIPEThe composite heat-pipe combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently manage the heat transfer between two solid interfaces which increase cooling capacity.PROTECTION BACK PLATEThe back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection. EXTREME DURABILITY AND OVERCLOCKINGThe graphics card uses the better power phases design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature, and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET, plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors, to provide excellent performance and longer system life. FRIENDLY PCB DESIGNFully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface. This friendly design prevents your hands from getting cut or inadvertently damaging components when making your build.

904,,Sony α7R III 35mm Full-frame Camera With Autofocus - ILCE7RM3/B,"Back-illuminated 42.4 MP full-frame sensorThe 35 mm full-frame Exmor R CMOS image sensor features 42.4-megapixel resolution, back illumination and gapless on-chip lens design for extraordinary sensitivity and dynamic range, anti-reflection (AR) coating on sensor seal glass, and other innovations that unleash the sensor's power to make images look realistic.Further enhanced image processing engineThe latest front-end LSI makes data readout from the image sensor approximately two times faster and the BIONZ X image processor is now about 1.8 times faster. Enhanced image processing realizes lower noise and further extended dynamic range across a wide sensitivity range of up to ISO 32000 (standard ISO, expandable to ISO 50-102400 for stills). Moreover, upgraded Detail Reproduction and Area-specific Noise Reduction achieves noise reduction–equivalent of approx. one stop–in mid-range ISO settings. Also, reproduction of skin colour has been dramatically improved, which is advantageous for portrait shooting. The 7R III also supports 14-bit RAW output even during silent shooting/continuous shooting.A quantum leap in AF performanceAn evolved image processing system and 9 camera AF algorithms optimised for the 7R III improve AF speed, precision, and tracking performance. 399 phase-detection AF points and 425 contrast-detection AF points provide high-density wide-area coverage. Up to approximately two times faster AF speed and two times more precise AF tracking performance let you capture and maintain focus on nimble wildlife in unpredictable motion. The 7R III also autofocuses reliably down to EV-3 brightness.Eye AF with doubled tracking performanceEye AF's enhanced precision, plus two times greater AF speed and AF tracking performance further assist you to easily shoot a portrait of a moving subject using AF-C even during continuous shooting, and even if the subject looks down and away from the camera, or is backlit with face in partial darkness. The 7R III's E-mount body supports Eye AF for A-mount lenses mounted via an adaptor.Focal-plane phase-detection AF supports A-mount lensesPhase-detection AF can operate even when an A-mount lens is mounted to the 7R III via an LA-EA3 adaptor that doesn't include a dedicated phase detection AF sensor. The 399-point focal-plane phase-detection AF system provides wide-area coverage, fast response, and high-performance tracking whether an A-mount or E-mount lens is attached.Up to 10fps with AF/AE trackingWith new shutter unit and image processing system refinements, the 7R III can shoot continuously at up to 10fps with AF/AE tracking (up to 8fps with minimal display lag in live-view continuous shooting mode) for easy, stable shooting of even intensely active subjects. An electronic shutter allows silent, vibration-free shooting of wildlife when even slight noise can mean missing an ideal shot.Up to 76 images in continuous shootingGreater buffer memory, system speed, and UHS-II support allow the 7R III to capture up to approx. 28 uncompressed RAW, or 76 compressed RAW or JPEG images in a continuous burst at 10fps. Fn menu/menu display access, setting changes and review playback can occur during data writing. A countdown of the number of still images remaining to be written to memory is on display during playback.AF-ON button and multi-selectorThe AF-ON button activates autofocus without any half-press-shutter-button focus sequence, so you can concentrate better on exactly when to release the shutter and capture the moment instantly. A multi-selector lets you shift the point of focus quickly and efficiently. You can select and shift the point of focus intuitively, so you won't miss great chances to shoot moving subjects.Anti-flicker shootingFlicker from fluorescent and other artificial lighting is automatically detected and shutter action is timed to minimize the flicker's effect on still images. This suppresses exposure and colour anomalies at the top and bottom of images shot at high shutter speeds, as well as exposure and colour inconsistency between continuous shots, so you can take images indoors with more confidence.In-body 5-axis image stabilization with up to 5.5-stop shutter speed advantageNow more effective than ever for the series, this comprehensive system compensates for five types of camera shake that tend to blur images: pitch/yaw shake when shooting at longer focal lengths; X/Y shake in close-up (including macro) shooting; and roll shake when recording stills at night and movies. It effectively achieves 5.5-stop-faster shutter speed, so the 7R III can take full advantage of its 42.4-megapixel and live-view image performance. Furthermore, it functions with A-mount lenses attached via mount adaptor, as well as E-mount lenses.Pixel Shift Multi Shooting opens a new world of resolutionApplying mechanisms and control technology of image stabilization, this new feature composites four separate pixel-shifted images that contain total data equal to approx. 169.6 million, or 42.4 million x 4 (RGGB), pixels to reproduce a single optimal still image of super-high resolution, detailed texture, balanced colour, and realistic atmosphere, with minimal moir and colour artifacts. Images shot using this feature can be processed with the new Sony imaging software suite. [1] The image sensor is moved in 1-pix",3599.99,772,,

Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys and your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in the body decrease over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinolThe traditional ubiquinone form of CoQ10 is difficult for the body to absorb. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system shown to absorb up to 8 times better than ubiquinone. In people taking this form of ubiquinol, high levels of plasma CoQ10 can be achieved in only four weeks.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit has been shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy. When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit doubles levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form and promotes greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.CoQ10 and agingIn a pre-clinical model, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared with ubiquinone. In another pre-clinical study, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Do your part for a healthy heart Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is a powerful formula for heart health and youthful cellular energy support.

1090,HIKVISION,HIKVISION DS-7608NI-I2/8P,"DescriptionDownloadsHIKVISIONDS-7608NI-I2/8P is a modern IP network video recorder capable of monitoring, recording and playing back images from 8 IP cameras of megapixel resolutions, up to 12 MP. This model has been equipped with switch with 8 PoE ports for connecting and powering IP cameras. Its independent VGA (up to 1080p) and HDMI (up to 4K) monitor outputs can provide images with different layouts. Each monitor can display the video from any camera, in any screen division. Two SATA ports enable the user to install 2 hard drives, each with capacity up to 8 TB. The drives can be combined into one group, or one of them can work as redundant or read-only to increase the security of recordings. The user can setup the limit of disk space and assign different volumes for individual channels. Additionally, the NVR supports NAS (NFS) and SAN (iSCSI) disk arrays. In the case of disk space overflow, the newest data overwrites the oldest recordings. Built-in USB ports allow for connecting external memory sticks or disk drives in order to copy some files.The local recording and network transmission uses H.265, H.264+ or H.264 compression methods that provide good image quality with relatively small bandwidth and disk space consumption (in each case the selected type of compression must be supported by the cameras). The H.265 or H.264+ (especially effective in the case of static or quasi-static scenes) coding allows for higher compression ratios with preservation of image quality comparable with H.264. This further saves network and memory resources.The NVR supports alarms generated by VCA functions (face detection, license plate recognition, crossing virtual lines, area intrusion detection, an entry/exit to/from an area, loss of focus, etc.) implemented in cameras. The response to such an event (e.g. someone crosses virtual line in a specified direction) can be the change of the state of the alarm output, email notification sent to a monitoring center etc., depending on the configuration. Advanced analytics allows installers/users to implement more advanced projects, perform quick search of interesting events and preset intelligent recording that saves disk space.With the support of ANR (Automatic Network Replenishment), any IP camera equipped with a memory card can record video in the absence of network connection. After the restoration of the network connection, the recordings are automatically synchronized with those recorded on the NVR. This ensures continuous coverage of events, even in the case of communication problems between the camera and NVR.The menu of the DVR has been designed in a manner that helps everyone, even novice users, navigate and make changes to the settings. Both the layout of commonly used functions and graphic design meet the highest current standards. The support for Firefox, Opera, Safari eliminates the need for installing ActiveX components.IP CCTV systems based on Hikvision IP cameras and NVRs can be configured for continuous recording with special parameters in the case of specific events. Each channel can be configured individually in this aspect. It is possible to increase the frame and bit rates, independently of the continuous recording settings. After the occurrence of an event (motion detection, camera tampering etc), the NVR automatically switches to the event-recording mode (usually with higher parameters). During the rest of the time the recording is carried out in the continuous mode. The increased parameters just before and after the event allow to play back every second of the period with high detail and smoothness, while the recordings between events may have a much lower performance, taking significantly less space on the storage media.The NVR can be managed and operated through a web browser or via free client software: iVMS 4200 (computers), iVMS 4500 (smartphones).Key featuresRecording resolution up to 12 MPResolution of independent video outputs: HDMI up to 4K@30/60 Hz, VGA up to 1080p@60 HzMax total bandwidth (input/output): 80/256 MbpsSupport of up to 8 IP cameras (Hikvision or ONVIF-compliant)Built-in switch with 8 PoE portsSynchronous playback of recordings from 8 channelsPlace for two SATA HDDs, each up 8 TBSupport for H.265/H.264+/H.264/MPEG4 video compressionVCA functions (face detection, license plate recognition, crossing virtual lines, area intrusion detection etc.)Support for ANR functionChannel 0 - possibility to monitor all cameras with minimum demand for network bandwidthUSB 2.0, USB 3.0, and RS232 interfacesAlarm inputs/outputs: 4/1Monitoring of statuses of LAN, cameras, HDDsDevelopment SupportSDK for Windows and Linux systemsSource code of software application for demoDevelopment support and training for use of application-I2: 6K, 2x HDD-8P: 8x PoE* The realised design of the productand/orits technical specification can differ from this description.Datasheet ofDS-7608NI-I2/8PQuick guide ofDS-7608NI-I2/8PUser Manual of DS-7608NI-I2/8P",373.99,862,,

1276,,Canon EOS Rebel SL3 DSLR Camera with 18-55mm STM Lens [Black],"Defined by its notably sleek form factor, the blackCanon EOS Rebel SL3is a versatile DSLR offering an ideal mix of stills and video capabilities. Featuring a 24.1MP APS-C-format CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 image processor, high-resolution stills and UHD 4K video recording are possible, along with a wide ISO 100-25600 sensitivity range to suit working in a variety of lighting conditions. In-camera 4K time-lapse movie creation is also possible for creatively depicting subjects over time. Benefitting the imaging attributes, the sensor's design also facilitates Dual Pixel CMOS AF, which uses phase-detection autofocus for quick, accurate, and smooth focusing performance when recording movies or shooting stills in live view. When shooting stills using the optical viewfinder, a 9-point phase-detection system is used for quick and accurate focusing in a variety of shooting scenarios.Within the compact body design, a large 3.0\"" 1.04m-dot touchscreen LCD is featured for intuitive settings control and live view monitoring, and it uses a vari-angle design to permit easier viewing from high and low working angles. Additionally, built-in Wi-Fi is available for quick and convenient pairing with a smartphone or tablet for wireless image sharing, and Bluetooth is also featured for image sharing to and remote camera control from a mobile device.24.1MP APS-C CMOS Sensor and DIGIC 8 Image ProcessorBoth a 24.1MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 image processor are used to deliver high sensitivity and fast camera performance to suit both stills and video applications. A flexible native ISO 100-25600 range suits working in a variety of lighting conditions, and the processing capabilities minimize noise for notable clarity. The processor also enables up to 5 fps continuous shooting as well as UHD 4K video recording and a 4K time-lapse movie mode.UHD 4K Video RecordingIn addition to stills recording, the SL3 also supports UHD 4K24p video recording, as well as Full HD and HD recording. Video recording is benefitted by the inclusion of Dual Pixel CMOS AF and the Movie Servo AF focusing functions, as well as the touchscreen design of the LCD monitor for intuitive control. Movie Digital IS also helps to steady recordings by minimizing the appearance of camera shake across five axes for smoother footage. Additionally, an external microphone jack is incorporated in the body design for greater control over your recorded sound.Employing the video capabilities, a dedicated Time-Lapse Movie mode can also be used to creatively depict subjects over a longer span of time. Interval settings between 1 second and 60 minutes are available for between 2 and 3600 consecutive frames. These individual frames can then be automatically compiled into a 4K or Full HD video file for seamless playback.9-Point Phase-Detection AF and Dual Pixel CMOS AFBenefitting stills shooting with the optical viewfinder, a 9-point phase-detection autofocus system provides quick and precise focusing in difficult lighting conditions. The center point is also a cross-type for enhanced accuracy and speed.When recording video or shooting in live view, a Dual Pixel CMOS AF system is employed that offers smooth and fast focusing performance in a similar manner to how a camcorder acquires focus. This system integrates two separate photodiodes within each pixel to provide a broad and dense network of phase-detection gathering elements across a majority of the image sensor to reduce focus hunting for faster, more direct control of focus placement. When working with still imagery, this focusing system works to acquire focus quickly and accurately, making it ideally suited to shooting and tracking moving subjects so that critical focus is attained with each shot. Eye Detection AF can also be employed to prioritize focus on a recognized subject's eye. When shooting video, a Movie Servo AF mode offers smooth and natural focusing when changing from different subjects or different distances within the scene, as well as the ability to specify tracking sensitivity, AF speed, and Face Tracking priority. Benefited by the Touch AF system, rack focus is possible simply by touching elements within the scene on the touchscreen in order to change focus in an intuitive manner. Subject tracking in movies is also heightened due to the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system's ability to recognize subjects and maintain focus when working within changing or cluttered scenery.Body Design and Wireless ConnectivityLarge 3.0\"" 1.04m-dot touchscreen LCD provides an intuitive method for controlling focusing points, navigating menus, and reviewing imagery. This screen also features a vari-angle design to better enable working from high and low angles.Optical pentamirror viewfinder serves a clear means for eye-level shooting.Built-in Wi-Fi allows for easy wireless sharing of both photos and movies to a linked mobile device.Bluetooth permits linking a smartphone or tablet for quick image sharing between devices as well as remote control capabilities.Included LP-E17 rechargeable lithium-ion battery provides approximately 1630 shots per charge when working with the viewfinder, or approximately 350 shots per charge when working in live view.EF-S 18-55mm f/4-5.6 IS STM LensIncluded with the camera body is the EF-S 18-55mm f/4-5.6 IS STM lens, which provides a 28.8-88mm equivalent focal length range that covers a variety of perspectives from wide-angle to portrait-length. Its design integrates an STM focusing mechanism that provides near-silent focusing abilities with smooth and precise control. Additionally, the Optical Image Stabilizer system helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to four shutter speed steps in order to benefit working in low-light conditions and with greater zoom magnifications.Other Camera FeaturesCreative Assist makes it easy to adjust camera settings and see the effects in real time, making it more straightforward to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation effects and see how the resulting image will look.Feature Assistant and Shooting Mode Guide can be used to explain and illustrate the camera's various shooting modes in order to become more familiar with all of the capabilities.Smooth Skin mode offers five levels of skin smoothing to help reduce blemishes and make subjects' skin appear soft.Picture Style: Auto, Standard, Portrait, Landscape, Fine Detail, Neutral, Faithful, Monochrome, and User Defined 1-3Scene Modes: Portrait, Smooth Skin, Group Photo, Landscape, Sports, Kids, Close-Up, Food, Candlelight, Night Portrait, Handheld Night Scene, HDR Backlight ControlCreative Filters: Grainy B/W, Soft Focus, Fish-Eye Effect, Water Painting Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect, HDR Art (Standard/Vivid/Bold/Embossed)Language Support: English, German, French, Dutch, Danish, Portuguese, Finnish, Italian, Ukraine, Norwegian, Swedish, Spanish, Greek, Russian, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Vietnamese, Hindi, Romanian, Turkish, Arabic, Thai, Simplified/Traditional Chinese, Korean, Malay, Indonesian, and Japanese.In the Box",649.00,1007,,

Just like its namesake, the Phoenix also boasts a long lifespan with features like IP5X dust resistance, dual ball fan bearings, and Auto-Extreme Technology. If you're looking for a nimble sidekick that will keep pushing pixels for years to come, the Phoenix is your beast.Wing-blade fan design incorporates drooped tips on each blade to reduce dragIP5X dust resistance offers protection from particle ingress for better durabilityDual ball fan bearings can last up to twice as long as sleeve bearing designsAuto-Extreme Technology uses automation to enhance reliabilityGPU Tweak II provides intuitive performance tweaking, thermal controls, and system monitoring2x longer lifespanDifferent bearing types have unique pros and cons. Ball bearings excel at durability and can last up to twice as long as sleeve-bearing designs.Keep it cleanDust is enemy number one for fans. It's easy to clean the blades, but taking the fan apart to remove dust that has made its way inside is not a simple task. Passing the IP5X certification means the housing is safe from nasty particulates, so you'll never need that deep clean.Compact designThe Phoenix packs potent rendering power into a compact frame that maximizes compatibility with the chassis.Precision automated manufacturingAuto-Extreme Technology is an automated manufacturing process that sets standards in the industry by allowing all soldering to be completed in a single pass.

Revolving around a full-frame 42.4MP Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor and updated BIONZ X image processor, the a7R III affords an impressive 10 fps continuous shooting rate along with improved autofocus performance for faster, more reliable subject tracking along with wide frame coverage. This updated Fast Hybrid AF System employs a combination of 399 phase-detection points and 425 contrast-detection areas for quicker acquirement of focus in a variety of lighting conditions, and also maintains focus on subjects more effectively. In addition to speed and AF, the processing improvements also help to realize greater image clarity throughout the sensitivity range from ISO 100-32000, which can further be expanded to ISO 50-102400. Video recording capabilities have also been extended for enhanced quality when recording UHD 4K video with the full width of the full-frame sensor, or when using a Super35 area and 5K oversampling to minimize moiré and aliasing. Additionally, benefitting both stills and video operation, the a7R III retains the 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift image stabilization, which is now effective to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to 5.5 stops.In addition to imaging updates, the a7R III also sports a revised body design, which includes a 3.69m-dot Tru-Finder OLED electronic viewfinder for bright, clear, and realistic eye-level monitoring. A rear 3.0\"" 1.44m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD is also available for intuitive settings control and to better support working from high and low angles. For greater shooting flexibility, dual SD memory card slots are now featured, and a larger NP-FZ100 battery is also employed to achieve up to approximately 530 shots per charge when using the viewfinder. Suiting the camera's use in trying conditions, the magnesium alloy chassis and extensive weather-sealing also render the a7R III dust- and moisture-resistance42.4 MP Exmor R BSI CMOS Sensor and BIONZ X Image ProcessorFeaturing a back-illuminated design, the full-frame 42.4-megapixel Exmor R CMOS sensor works with the BIONZ X image processor to offer high-resolution stills and video while minimizing noise and improving speed. This sensor structure works with gapless on-chip lens design and an anti-reflection coating, as well as eliminating the optical low-pass filter, to improve light collection and enhance detail. Also, the copper wiring layer dramatically improves data transmission speed for creating 14-bit, high-resolution 42.4-megapixel stills with a native sensitivity range from ISO 100-32000, which can be further expanded to ISO 50-102400. Also, it enables internal UHD 4K video recording with a wide dynamic range using the full width of the full-frame sensor. The BIONZ X processor also works in conjunction with a high-speed front-end LSI to realize faster processing times along with the ability to capture an impressive 15-stop dynamic range at low sensitivity values.The sensor and processor combination also avails fast continuous shooting at up to 10 fps at full resolution, for up to 76 consecutive frames, and with full-time AF/AE when working with either a mechanical shutter or an electronic shutter. If shooting in live view mode, a continuous shooting rate of up to 8 fps is also possible.Fast Hybrid AF SystemAn evolved 4D FOCUS system now employs a combination of 399 phase-detection points, which cover approximately 68% of the frame, along with 425 contrast-detection areas for reliable and quick autofocus and subject tracking performance. This Fast Hybrid AF System now achieves twice the focusing speed and more reliable tracking compared to previous a7R models, as well as improved low-light focusing response down to -3 EV. The use of phase-detection points also enables the use of A-mount lenses via the optional LA-EA3 or LA-EA1 lens mount adapters with full continuous AF/AE tracking compatibility.The apt focus system also lends itself to a variety of focusing functions for refined accuracy, including Lock-on AF, which maintains focus on moving subjects throughout the use of a configurable frame that is set over the desired moving subject, and Expand Flexible Spot, which employs neighboring focus points to retain focus on moving subjects even if the originally selected point loses focus. Additionally, Eye AF can be used to base focus on recognized subjects' eyes for portraits and is available in both AF-S and AF-C modes. Autofocus can also be used in conjunction with the Focus Magnifier function for critical focus when homing in on minute subject details. The rear touchscreen can also be used for Touch Focus control, and a Touchpad Focus Control mode lets you use the rear screen intuitively while keeping your eye to the viewfinder.For more personalized control over focus, and benefitting working in either vertical or horizontal shooting orientation, the AF area can be switched in orientation to better suit your subject matter. AF tracking sensitivity can also be customized in five steps to match how a subject is moving and frequently used focus point settings can be memorized and recalled with a custom button for faster switching between focus settings.5-Axis SteadyShot INSIDE Image StabilizationPacked into the robust a7R III is a 5.5-stop effective 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization system that compensates for five different types of camera shake encountered during handheld shooting of stills and video. This allows users to confidently use any lens, even adapted lenses, for critical imaging without encountering blur from camera shake.For long focal lengths, the system will correct for pitch and yaw adjustments. Macro and high-magnification imagery, on the other hand, will benefit from the inclusion of horizontal and vertical shift compensation. All shooting styles will get usage out of the roll compensation. All 5 axes of stabilization will function at all times, even when used with third-party lenses and adapters or lenses with built-in optical stabilization.UHD 4K Video Recording in XAVC S FormatInternal recording of UHD 4K movies is possible in multiple frame rates up to 30 fps and, based on the Super35mm recording area and effective 5K resolution, oversampling renders greater detail and full pixel readout is possible, that is void of pixel binning, for higher quality imagery with reduced moiré and aliasing. Full-frame 4K recording has also been dramatically improved for improved quality when working at mid to high sensitivities to permit full use of the entire sensor width. Full HD 1080p recording is also supported in frame rates up to 120 fps, and both resolutions utilize the 100 Mbps XAVC S format contained within an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling. The high-speed, 120 fps recording also enables 4x and 5x slow-motion movie recording with the frame rate set to either 30p or 24p. In addition to high-resolution internal recording, uncompressed HDMI output also enables the use of an optional external recorder for clean 4K recording with 4:2:2 sampling.4K video recording also avails the ability to produce 8MP stills during playback by taking a frame grab from a movie and storing it as a separate file.Additional Video FeaturesSupport for HDR Content:Affording extensive customizable color and gamma controls, the a7R III allows users to adjust the gamma, black level, knee, color level, and more. Also, users can use the same S-Log2 Gamma Curve that is found on high end Sony Cinema cameras that squeezes up to 1300% more dynamic range into the video signal then traditional REC709, for increased post-production flexibility. HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) support is also available, along with the BT.2020 color space, for recording within a wide color gamut and, in addition to S-Log2, S-Log3 is also available for producing an effective 14-stop dynamic range with increased grading control in the shadow to mid-tone regions of the image.Slow & Quick Motion:Take more control over your video capture capabilities with a variety of new frame rates available in an S&Q mode. This will allow shooters to capture Full HD video at one of either steps between 1-120 fps. These settings will allow you to slow down action as well as speed up a slow-moving scene. This setting is also NTSC/PAL switchable.Enhanced Zebra Function:An enhanced Zebra function is ideally suited to aid in monitoring exposure values in high-contrast scenes. Video signal level targets can be set from 0 to 109, and specific ranges can be set to make exposure level adjustments easier.Time Code and User Bit Settings:A time code can be used to record hours, minutes, seconds, frames on image data for more precise editing while the User Bit function can record date, time, and scene number to aid in editing together footage from multiple cameras.Proxy Recording:UHD 4K movies and lower-resolution proxy movies can be simultaneously recorded. The smaller proxy files are ideal for quick previewing or pre-editing that can reduce the time required for final 4K editing.Body Design and Built-In Wi-Fi/BluetoothAn updated Quad-VGA OLED Tru-Finder EVF is featured, and has a 3.69m-dot resolution for bright, clear viewing in high detail. Both Standard and High quality settings can be used, depending on the shooting situation, in order to optimize the viewing experience. This updated viewfinder design also affords the use of autofocus in the Focus Magnifier mode as well as improved focusing peaking to benefit manual focus operation.In addition to the EVF, a 3.0\"" 1.44m-dot rear LCD is also available, which has a touch panel design for intuitive operation and focusing control. The screen also tilts upward 107° and downward 41° to benefit working from high and low angles.Magnesium alloy chassis assures rigidity, durability, and stability while remaining lightweight. The lens mount has also been improved to better support heavy lenses and the grip rigidity has been improved for more comfortable hand-holding.A durable shutter unit incorporates a coreless motor and brake system that reduces vibrations to better control shutter shock as well as extend its rated lifespan to approximately 500,000 actuations.Weather-sealing has been employed to resist dust and moisture for reliable operation in harsh weather conditions.Using the same NP-FZ100 battery as the a9, the a7R III has improved battery life and is now rated for approximately 530 shots per charge with the EVF or 650 shots with the rear LCD.Dual SD memory card slots allow for flexible file saving and handling, and can be configured to partition raw and JPEG files or can be used for overflow recording. One of the card slots is rated to support UHS-II memory cards.Integrated PC sync terminal for wired flash sync with strobe packs or wireless radio remotes.A USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C port has been added, in addition to a micro-USB port, for faster, more reliable tethering support.

1413,,Sony FE 24-70mm F4 Lens,"Walk around all day with theVario-Tessar T* FE 24-70mm f/4 ZA OSS LensfromSony, a compact full-frame option that covers wide-angle to short telephoto perspectives for working with a variety of different shooting styles and subjects. A constant f/4 aperture makes operation smooth and consistent throughout the zoom range. The lens further benefits from the use of one extra-low dispersion element and five aspherical elements to combat aberrations as well as a Zeiss T* anti-reflective coating to keep flare and ghosting to an absolute minimum. The lens is fast to focus as well due to the linear autofocus motor and an internal focus design. Additionally, the dust- and moisture-resistant lens is equipped with Optical SteadyShot image stabilization to reduce the effects of camera shake, and it has a seven-blade circular diaphragm for smooth bokeh.Based on the Zeiss Tessar optical concept, this lens uses a design with 12 elements in ten groups that helps ensure a smaller overall lens size along with reduced flaring, distortion, and chromatic aberrations.Covering wide-angle to short telephoto perspectives, this compact 24-70mm can quickly become a go-to lens for Sony's full-frame E-mount cameras. It can also be used on APS-C format cameras where it will provide a 36-105mm equivalent zoom range.A constant f/4 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and also lends greater control over focus position for shallow depth of field techniques.Zeiss T* anti-reflective coatings have been applied to each lens surface to help minimize reflections in order to provide greater image clarity, contrast, and color fidelity.One extra-low dispersion glass element is featured in the lens design to help reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing for improved clarity and color neutrality.Five aspherical elements are incorporated in the lens design to reduce astigmatism, field curvature, coma, and other monochromatic aberrations.Optical SteadyShot image stabilization helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper imagery when shooting handheld with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization system can also be combined with select camera's sensor-shift type image stabilization for more effective control of camera blur.A linear autofocus motor and internal focus design provide quick and precise autofocus performance and enables accurate and silent focusing while recording videos.Dust- and moisture-sealed design better permits working in inclement conditions and rubberized control rings benefit handling in colder temperatures.Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality when employing selective focus techniques.",7.98E2,109,,

These elements, coupled with an advanced optical design, work to minimize sagittal coma flare and chromatic aberrations in order to provide high image sharpness and clarity. The lens' large diameter and floating system also help to correct for vignetting to ensure maintained peripheral brightness. A Super Multi Coating has been applied to lens elements, too, to reduce flare and ghosting for higher contrast and color fidelity. Additionally, making it an ideal lens for portraiture, the bright f/1.4 maximum aperture pairs with a rounded nine-blade diaphragm to benefit selective focus and shallow depth of field imaging with smooth bokeh.Complementing the imaging capabilities, the lens sports a Hyper Sonic Motor to produce quick, smooth, and quiet autofocus performance with full-time manual focus override. The physical design utilizes Thermally Stable Composite material for durability in a wide range of environments, and a brass bayonet mount also offers rigidity and mounting precision.As part of the Art line within Sigma's Global Vision series, this lens is designed to achieve truly notable optical performance and is ideally suited for creative and artistic applications.Prime normal-length lens is designed for full-frame Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras, however it can also be used with APS-C models where it will provide a 75mm equivalent focal length.Bright f/1.4 maximum aperture is well-suited for working in low-light conditions and also provides greater control over the focus position when using shallow depth of field techniques.Three Special Low Dispersion (SLD) elements are featured in the optical design, and help to reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations for improved clarity and color accuracy.One aspherical element reduces distortion and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness and accurate rendering.A Super Multi-Layer Coating has been applied to lens elements in order to minimize lens flare and ghosting and contribute to producing contrast-rich and color-neutral imagery, even in backlit conditions.Nine-blade rounded diaphragm contributes to a smooth and pleasing bokeh quality.The integrated HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) realizes quick and quiet autofocusing, which is further complemented by an optimized AF algorithm to produce smoother focusing performance. The HSM also permits full-time manual focus control simply by rotating the focus ring at any time.The lens is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite (TSC) material, along with traditional metals, for greater precision and use in wide temperature variations.The bayonet mount is constructed from brass for ensured accuracy and durability. Additionally, rubber sealing is incorporated in the mount design to render it dust- and splash-resistant.",0.0,1095,,

With support for up to 32 high-definition surveillance cameras this 3TB hard drive can hold a large amount of data and gives you the ability to easily upgrade and expand your security system. Low power consumption is crucial in high-temperature always-on surveillance environments.

When you invest in a premium surveillance-class drive you worry less while enjoying the benefits over a longer period of time.Highlights•3TB capacity holds up to 600,000 digital photos, 750,000 MP3 files, and 360 hours of HD video.•Built for always-on surveillance storage applications•AllFrame technology for reduced pixilation and video interruption•Designed to support up to 32 HD cameras•Caching algorithms specifically designed for security surveillance operation•3.5\"" Form Factor•6 Gb/s Data Transfer Rate•64MB Cache•300,000 Load/Unload Cycles•Surveillance Class StorageFeaturesSurveillance-Class DriveWestern Digital Purple surveillance-class storage has been tested to be compatible in a wide-range of security systems. These drives are designed to replace standard desktop drives that were not designed for the 24/7 always-on, high-definition surveillance environment. Desktop drives are built to run for only short intervals and are not engineered to withstand high-temperature fluctuations and equipment vibrations found in a typical surveillance application.Surveillance StorageThe Western Digital Purple Surveillance Hard Drive is designed for high temperature, always-on, surveillance security systems to ensure reliability and quality video play back when you need it most.Improve Performance with AllFrameThis Western Digital Purple Surveillance-class hard drive is equipped with AllFrame technology which works with ATA streaming to reduce frame loss, improve playback and increase the number of drive bays supported.

Western Digital Purple with AllFrame provides the confidence you should expect when it's time to play back and review critical surveillance footage.Low Power ConsumptionWith integrated IntelliSeek technology, this Western Digital Purple drive calculates the optimum seek speed which lowers power consumption, noise and vibration that can damage and cause drives to wear out more quickly.CompatibilityWestern Digital Purple Storage Drives are specifically designed for Surveillance security systems using PVR, DVR, NVR recorders that use up to eight hard drives and up to 32 cameras at once.Specifications•Stock Code - WD30PURX•Description - Western Digital (WD)Purple 3TB Surveillance Hard Drive•Formatted Capacity-3TB•Interface- Buffer to Host: 6 Gb/s SATA III maximum•Host to/from Drive (sustained): 145 MB/s•User Sectors Per Drive-3,907,029,168•Rotational Speed-IntelliPower controlled RPM•Buffer Size -64MB•Load / Unload-300,000 Cycles•Read Errors-Less than 1 non-recoverable bit per 1014 bits read•Acoustics-Idle: 23dBA•Seek Mode: 24dBA•Operating Temp: 0 ~ 65° C (32 ~ 149° F)•Non-Operating Temp : -40 ~ 70° C (-40 ~ 158° F)•Power Input-12Vdc•Power Usage-Typical Read / Write: 4.4W/ Idle: 4.1W/ Standby &amp; Sleep Modes: 0.6W•Compatibility: Windows/MacDimensions &amp; Weight•Dimensions-(WxDxH) 101.6 x 147.0 x 26.1mm•Weight-640g",1920.61,1113,,

1504,,Sony Vario-Tessar T* FE 24-70mm f/4 ZA OSS Lens,"The Sony Vario-Tessar T* FE 24-70mm f/4 ZA OSS Lens is designed to be a compact full-frame option that covers wide-angle to short telephoto perspectives for working with a variety of different shooting styles and subjects. The dust- and moisture-resistant lens is equipped with Optical SteadyShot image stabilization to reduce the effects of camera shake, and it has a seven-blade circular diaphragm for smooth bokeh. A constant f/4 aperture makes operation smooth and consistent throughout the zoom range. The lens further benefits from the use of one extra-low dispersion element and five aspherical elements to combat aberrations as well as a Zeiss T* anti-reflective coating to keep flare and ghosting to an absolute minimum. The lens is fast to focus as well due to the linear autofocus motor and an internal focus design. Based on the Zeiss Tessar optical concept, this lens uses a design with 12 elements in ten groups that helps ensure a smaller overall lens size along with reduced flaring, distortion, and chromatic aberrations. Covering wide-angle to short telephoto perspectives, this compact 24-70mm can quickly become a go-to lens for Sony's full-frame E-mount cameras. It can also be used on APS-C format cameras where it will provide a 36-105mm equivalent zoom range. A constant f/4 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and also lends greater control over focus position for shallow depth of field techniques. Zeiss T* anti-reflective coatings have been applied to each lens surface to help minimize reflections in order to provide greater image clarity, contrast, and color fidelity. One extra-low dispersion glass element is featured in the lens design to help reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing for improved clarity and color neutrality. Five aspherical elements are incorporated in the lens design to reduce astigmatism, field curvature, coma, and other monochromatic aberrations. Optical SteadyShot image stabilization helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper imagery when shooting handheld with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization system can also be combined with select camera's sensor-shift type image stabilization for more effective control of camera blur. A linear autofocus motor and internal focus design provide quick and precise autofocus performance and enables accurate and silent focusing while recording videos. Dust- and moisture-sealed design better permits working in inclement conditions and rubberized control rings benefit handling in colder temperatures. Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality when employing selective focus techniques.",799.99,449,,

1560,,FUJIFILM XF 16mm f/2.8 R WR Lens - Silver,"The FUJIFILM XF 16mm f/2.8 R WR Lens - Silver is a 24mm-equivalent wide-angle lens, well-suited to landscape, nature, and architectural shooting. Its f/2.8 maximum aperture balances size and speed, and is suitable for working in available lighting conditions while also limiting the overall size and weight of the lens for everyday use. The optical design features two aspherical elements to reduce distortion and spherical aberrations in order to produce greater sharpness and accurate rendering. A Super EBC coating is also used to control flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in bright and backlit conditions. Complementing the optics is a stepping motor, along with an internal focusing design, which provides quick and especially quiet focusing performance. Additionally, the lens is weather-sealed to suit working in inclement conditions. Key Features Prime wide-angle lens is designed for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 24mm equivalent focal length. Moderately bright f/2.8 maximum aperture suits working in available light conditions and also helps to maintain a compact form factor. Two aspherical elements limit distortion and spherical aberration in order to realize greater sharpness and accurate rendering. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Stepping motor, along with an internal focusing design, affords fast and quiet autofocus performance that benefits both stills and video applications. The lens body incorporates weather sealing to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions and freezing temperatures as low as 14°F. Rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality.",399.95,1161,,
1561,,PalmettoGuard® Saw Palmetto-Nettle Root Formula with Beta-Sitosterol,"Published studies suggest that a remarkably high percentage of men will endure some form of prostate-induced discomfort over the course of their lifetimes.1,2 Decades of research3,4 substantiate saw palmetto as the gold standard in natural prostate support.The saw palmetto berry (Serenoa repens) is rich in bioactive, high-molecular weight compounds including beta-sitosterol. It has been shown to interfere with DHT activity in the prostate, inhibit alpha-adrenergic receptor activity (to support normal urinary flow), and help regulate inflammatory actions in the prostate gland.5-7Super Saw Palmetto/Nettle Root Formula with Beta-Sitosterol combines saw palmetto with a nettle root extract, boron, and rosemary to support a healthy prostate.5-21 Testosterone converts to estrogen at higher rates as men age. Prostate cells are sensitive to estrogen's growth stimulatory effects. Nettle root helps support prostate cells against excess estrogen levels.9This saw palmetto extract has been standardized to contain 136 milligrams total fatty acids and sterols per one softgel capsule.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingSaw Palmetto CO2 extract (fruit) [providing 136 mg total fatty acids]160 mgBeta-Sitosterol (from pine)45 mgStinging and Dwarf nettle extracts (root)120 mgBoron (as Albion® bororganic glycine)1.5 mgRosemary extract (leaf)400 mcgOther ingredients: pumpkin seed oil, gelatin, glycerin, sunflower lecithin, purified water, beeswax, maltodextrin, carob color.Non-GMOAlbion® is a registered trademark of Albion Laboratories, Inc.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel in the morning and one (1) softgel in the evening, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.This product can be taken with or without food.WarningsKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSEDo not purchase if outer seal is broken or damaged.When using nutritional supplements, please consult with your physician if you are undergoing treatment for a medical condition or if you are pregnant or lactating.To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-866-280-2852.?Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel in the morning and one (1) softgel in the evening, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.This product can be taken with or without food.These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.This product is not for use by or sale to persons under the age of 18.

1593,Apple,Apple AirPods with Wireless Charging Case - 2nd Generation,"The new 2nd generation Apple AirPods at RC Willey — complete with Wireless Charging Case — deliver the wireless headphone experience, reimagined. Just pull them out of the case and they’re ready to use with your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac. After a simple one-tap setup, AirPods work like magic. They’re automatically on and always connected. AirPods can even sense when they’re in your ears and pause when you take them out. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, simply say “Hey Siri” and make your request. You have the freedom to wear one or both AirPods, and you can play or skip forward with a double-tap when listening to music or podcasts. Charge your AirPods quickly and easily with the Wireless Charging Case. Just set the case down on a Qi-compatible charging mat and let it charge. The LED indicator on the front of the case lets you know that your AirPods are charging. And when you’re away from a charging mat, you can use the Lightning port to charge. AirPods deliver 5 hours of listening time and 3 hours of talk time on a single charge. And they’re made to keep up with you, thanks to a Wireless Charging Case that holds multiple charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Need a quick charge? Just 15 minutes in the case gives you 3 hours of listening time or 2 hours of talk time. Powered by the all-new Apple H1 headphone chip, AirPods use optical sensors and motion accelerometers to detect when they’re in your ears. Whether you’re using both AirPods or just one, the H1 chip automatically routes the audio and engages the microphone. And when you’re on a call or talking to Siri, an additional speech-detecting accelerometer works with beamforming microphones to filter out external noise and focus on the sound of your voice.",199.99,406,,

1613,,D-Link DGS-1210-24,"The DGS-1210-24 is part of D-Link’s 3rd generation of Web Smart Switches that integrates advanced management and security functions for performance and scalability.Featuring an innovative fanless design that ensures quiet operation and a longer life span, the DGS-1210-24 provides a complete and affordable solution for small and medium businesses (SMB).Seamless IntegrationThe DGS-1210-24 includes 24 10/100/1000 Mbps ports capable of connecting to existing Cat.5 twisted-pair cables.Additionally, the last four ports of the DGS-1210-24 combine SFP and copper connectivity into one port and therefore provide a flexible solution for server connections via fiber interface. Using the default presets, the administrator can quickly set up the switch without worrying about reconfiguring any settings and providing easy access for the user.Extensive Layer 2 FeaturesEquipped with a complete lineup of L2 features, these switches include IGMP Snooping, Port Mirroring, Spanning Tree and Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). The IEEE 802.3x Flow Control function allows servers to directly connect to the switch for fast, reliable data transfer. At 2000 Mbps Full Duplex, the Gigabit ports provide high-speed data pipes to servers with minimum data transfer loss. Network maintenance features include Loopback Detection and Cable Diagnostics. Loopback Detection is used to detect loops created by a specific port and automatically shut down the affected port. Cable Diagnostics is designed for network administrators to quickly examine the quality of the copper cables and also determine the type of cable error.QoS & bandwidth controlThe switch is perfect for deployment in a VoIP environment, as it supports Auto Voice VLAN and Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) QoS for VoIP application. Auto Voice VLAN will automatically place voice traffic from an IP phone to an assigned VLAN and by doing so enhance the VoIP service. With a higher priority and individual VLAN, this feature guarantees the quality and security of VoIP traffic. DSCP marks parts of an IP packet, enabling different levels of service to be assigned for network traffic.With Bandwidth Control, the network administrator can reserve bandwidth for important functions that require a larger bandwidth or might have high priority.Secure your NetworkD-Link’s unique Safeguard Engine function protects the switch against traffic flooding caused by virus attacks. The switch also supports 802.1X port-based authentication, allowing the network to be authenticated through an external RADIUS server.In addition, the Access Control List (ACL) feature enhances network security and helps to protect the internal IT network. The DGS-1210-24 includes ARP Spoofing Prevention, which protects from attacks on the Ethernet network that may allow an intruder to sniff data frames on a LAN, modify traffic,or bring traffic to a halt altogether by sending fake ARP messages to the network. To prevent ARP Spoofing attacks, the switch uses Packet Control ACLs to block invalid packets that contain fake ARP messages. For added security, the DHCP Server Screening feature screens rogue DHCP server packets from user ports to prevent unauthorised IP assignment.Versatile ManagementThe DGS-1210-24 provides a SmartConsole utility and a web-based management interface that enables administrators to remotely control their network down to the port level. The SmartConsole easily allows customers to discover multiple D-Link Web Smart Switches within the same L2 network segment.With this utility, users do not need to change the IP address of their PC and it also provides an easy initial setting of the Smart Switches. Switches within the same L2 network segment that are connected to the user’s PC are displayed on screen for instant access.This allows extensive switch configuration settings and basic configuration of discovered devices such as password changes and firmware upgrades.The DGS-1210-24 also supports D-View 6.0, D-Link’s own Network Management System, and Compact Command Line Interface (CLI) through Telnet.CLI management of the switches is possible via Telnet. This makes the adjustment of basic settings like password changes or firmware and configuration file uploads possible.D-Link GreenThe DGS-1210-24 implements D-Link Green, an innovative concept that provides energy savings whitout sacrificing operational performance or functionality.The switch reacts when devices attached to it are turned off, by placing the corresponding port in a standby mode that requires less power. It also automatically detects the length of connected cables, which allows it to cut power usage on shorter cable connections up to 20 m.D-Link Green certification ensures that the switch complies with the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) directives. RoHS restrict the use of specific hazardous materials during the manufacture of electrical and electronic goods, while WEEE applies standards for proper disposal and recyclable packaging to help reduce wastage.-Third generation design, with improved management and security functions.-Fanless design ideal for use in open offices.-Power-saving D-Link Green technology now in its 2nd generation.-Solid security with 802.1X authentication and IP/MAC based Access Control Lists (ACL).-Malicious traffic and performance degradation prevention with D-Link Safeguard Engine™.-Auto Voice VLAN for the automatic prioritisation of digital voice traffic.-Quality of service (QoS) and bandwidth control (down to 64 kbps).-High Reliability with Loopback Detection (LBD) and cable diagnostics.-Simple Web based management.-SmartConsole utility for the joint management of several switches.",126.15,1185,,

The Sony A7R IV houses the most PACKED MP sensor on the full frame market right now, with a whopping 61 megapixels. In addition Sony have improved the autofocus capabilities in the Sony A7R IV allowing you now to use continuous eye AF in photo and video.Key Features:61MP Full-Frame Exmor R BSI CMOS SensorBIONZ X Image Processor & Front-End LSI567-Point Phase-Detection AF SystemUHD 4K30p Video with HLG & S-Log3 GammasErgonomics and handlingThe biggest difference of the a7R IV compared to the III and the rest of the a7 series is the deep grip. Holding the Sony a7R IV is super comfortable and a warm welcome for those with bigger hands. In addition the side doors on the Sony a7R IV have been redesigned making it easier to access your ports. A part from these changes the button layout and overall construction of the body is basically identical to the Sony a7RIII.PerformanceThe biggest performance boost for the Sony a7RIV is the improvement in autofocus. With a revamped autofocus system, the a7rIV is great for tracking, and general usage. In addition can use continuous eye AF in both stills and video.The image sensor on the Sony a7RIV is incredible, boasting a large 61MP. Images preserve a high amount of detail and resolution which can be manipulated by a large amount in post. View our image samples in our video below.ConclusionIs the Sony a7RIV a worthy upgrade from the a7RIII? It may not be the biggest upgrade on paper, however the new sensor, ergonomics and flashier AF system does make it justifiable. We had a great time using this camera and will be a popular one for the years to come.Watch our review of the Sony A7R IV below:",5285,800,,

The a7S III also does away with recording time limits and incorporates HLG for direct HDR production as well as S-Log2/S-Log3 gamma profiles for advanced HDR production with editing.The updated sensor design also brings improved autofocus performance via 759 phase-detection points, which offer intelligent subject tracking and Real-time Eye AF to ensure critical focus on moving subjects in all recording modes. The sensor and BIONZ XR processor also facilitate impressive sensitivity, with an expanded range from ISO 40-409600, as well as fast 10 fps continuous shooting for up to 1000 consecutive raw frames. Additionally, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift image stabilization is available, too, which minimizes the appearance of camera shake by up to 5.5 stops.Complementing the imaging assets, Sony has also made some changes to the a7S III's physical design, including a rear LCD with a side-open articulating design and an impressive 9.44m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder. The camera's menu system has also been updated for more intuitive navigation and the body design helps to promote better heat dissipation for improved continuous recording capabilities.

Decades of research substantiate saw palmetto as the gold standard in natural prostate support.The saw palmetto berry (Serenoa repens) is rich in bioactive, high-molecular weight compounds including beta-sitosterol. It has been shown to interfere with DHT activity in the prostate, inhibit alpha-adrenergic receptor activity (to support normal urinary flow), and help regulate inflammatory actions in the prostate gland.Super Saw Palmetto/Nettle Root Formula with Beta-Sitosterol combines saw palmetto with a nettle root extract, boron, and rosemary to support a healthy prostate. Testosterone converts to estrogen at higher rates as men age. Prostate cells are sensitive to estrogen's growth stimulatory effects. Nettle root helps support prostate cells against excess estrogen levels.This saw palmetto extract has been standardized to contain 136 milligrams total fatty acids and sterols per one softgel capsule.",18.35,1321,,

It combines powerful telephoto performance with great image quality and instinctive handling.Optical Image StabilizerTo help maintain sharpness, the EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM incorporates Canon’s Image Stabilizer technology. This allows shutter speeds up to 3.5 stops slower than normal to be used while protecting against the effects of camera shake – great in low light or when shooting at long zoom settings. Panning detection automatically turns off stabilisation in either the horizontal or vertical direction, helping convey a sense of speed when photographing moving subjects.STM technologyThe EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM features stepping motor (STM) technology for smooth, quiet continuous focusing when capturing video with your EOS and fast, accurate AF when shooting photos. STM focusing is so quiet that it’s not picked up by the camera’s microphone, leaving your video soundtracks free of unwanted distractions.Delivering superb image qualityThe EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM uses a UD (Ultra-low Dispersion) glass element and Super Spectra lens coatings to deliver crisp, sharp, high-contrast images throughout the zoom range. A seven-bladed aperture diaphragm increases the quality of out-of-focus areas, so your subject stands out against a soft, blurred background.Designed for great photographyA manual focus ring allows precise focus adjustments to be made quickly and easily at any time, while a closest focusing distance of 0.85m enables photography of small subjects.

All together, these integrated hardware technologies deliver effective heat dissipation.ALTERNATE SPINNINGGIGABYTE's patented “Alternate Spinning” is the best solution for fixing turbulent airflow caused by adjacent fans. Since the adjacent fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction becomes opposite between the fans, causing turbulent airflow and reducing heat-dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing turbulence and enhancing airflow pressure.UNIQUE BLADE FANAirflow is split by this graphics card's triangular fan edges. Moving air is guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing airflow.3D ACTIVE FANThe 3D Active Fan feature provides semi-passive cooling. Fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. This allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle.HEAT-PIPE DIRECT-TOUCH GPUThe shape of the pure-copper heat pipes maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU, enhancing heat transfer. The heat pipes also cover the VRAM through a large metal-plate contact to ensure proper cooling.EXTREME DURABILITY AND OVERCLOCKINGThis graphics card uses the 4+2 power-phase design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature. The over-temperature protection design, load-balancing feature for each MOSFET and Ultra Durable-certified chokes and capacitors provide excellent performance and longer system life.PROTECTIVE BACKPLATEThe backplate provides an attractive aesthetical shape and also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.",1260,293,,

2011,,Nikkor Z 24-70Mm F4S,Nikon NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/4 S LensCovering a useful range of focal lengths the NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/4 S is a versatile zoom spanning wide-angle to portrait-length perspectives. Its constant f/4 maximum aperture maintains a consistent exposure throughout the zoom range and also helps to realize a more compact and lightweight alternative to an f/2.8 zoom. In regard to the optical design a unique aspherical extra-low dispersion element in addition to three aspherical elements is used to help reduce chromatic aberrations and distortions throughout the zoom range in order to achieve high image sharpness and clarity. Both Nano Crystal and Super Integrated Coatings have also been applied to control flare and ghosting for greater contrast and color rendering in bright and backlit conditions. FeaturesStandard zoom covers a wide-angle to portrait-length range and is designed for FX-format Z-mount mirrorless cameras. Constant f/4 maximum aperture affords consistent performance throughout the zoom range and also contributes to the relatively lightweight design and compact form factor. A unique aspherical extra-low dispersion element is incorporated into the optical design along with three additional aspherical elements to greatly reduce chromatic and spherical aberrations distortion coma (comatic aberration) and flare for consistent edge-to-edge sharpness and illumination. A Nano Crystal Coat along with a Super Integrated Coating has been applied to lens elements to minimize surface and internal reflections for a marked reduction in lens flare and ghosting. Stepping motor delivers impressively smooth quiet and fast autofocus performance that is well-suited to both stills and video applications. Full-time manual focus override is also possible and an internal focusing design is used where only the internal lens groups are moved during focusing to maintain the overall length of the lens during use and to promote faster focusing speeds. Programmable Control Ring is by default set to adjust manual focus but can also be used to control aperture or exposure compensation. Specialized electromagnetic aperture mechanism provides greater exposure control stability that is especially beneficial when working with fast continuous shooting rates. Rounded seven-blade diaphragm promotes a pleasing out of focus quality that benefits the use of shallow depth of field and selective focus techniques. Exposed elements feature a fluorine coating that affords protection to the optical system against dust grease and water droplets. Dust- and moisture-resistant lens barrel benefits the lens' use in inclement conditions. Button-less retractable design maintains a compact form factor when the lens is not in use.SpecificationsFocal Length24 to 70mm Maximum Aperturef/4 Minimum Aperturef/22 Lens MountNikon Z Format CompatibilityFull-Frame Angle of View84° to 34°20' Maximum Magnification0.3x Minimum Focus Distance 30cm Optical Design14 Elements in 11 Groups Diaphragm Blades7 Rounded Focus TypeAutofocus Image StabilizationNone Filter Size72 mm (Front) Dimensions (ø x L)77.5 x 88.5mm,1.799E3,661,,

2060,,Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with BioPQQ (30 Softgels),"Life Extension continues to develop increasingly potent mitochondria-boosting formulations.The new Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with BioPQQ® contains shilajit (which studies have shown doubles CoQ10 levels in the mitochondria) plus the breakthrough compound PQQ(shown to support the spontaneous generation of new mitochondriain aging cells). This represents a three-way strategy for enhanced mitochondrial support.Super Ubiquinol CoQ10CoQ10 is required to convert the energy from fats and sugars you eat into usable cellular energy. More people are supplementing with CoQ10 than ever before. A key reason is increased awareness that the body’s production of CoQ10 declines significantly with advancing age.5Statin drugs also deplete CoQ10 levels in the blood, and possibly, tissues. For example, statin drugs reduce plasma CoQ10 by almost 40%—but the aging process itself reduces CoQ10 levels in the heart muscle wall by 72%.Studies show that absorption of the ubiquinol form of CoQ10 is far greater than the conventional ubiquinone form. In middle-aged mice, ubiquinolwas shown to be 40% more effective in slowing measurements of aging, compared to ubiquinone.Life Extension offers this highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of patented CoQ10 in an advanced delivery system, providing an unparalleled absorption level.Enhanced Support with ShilajitPrimaVie shilajithas been shown to doublelevels of CoQ10 in mitochondria.Combining CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in energy production in the brain—40% betterthan CoQ10 alone. And in muscle, there was a 144% increasein energy production—27% better than CoQ10 alone.Shilajit boosts CoQ10’s beneficial effects by stabilizing CoQ10 in the superior ubiquinol form.Additionally, shilajit facilitates more efficient delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria, which results in greater cellular energy production.Shilajit itself is rich in essential compounds that help the mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the body’s main source of energy.PQQ Promotes Growth of New MitochondriaUntil recently, the only options for aging individuals to promote replenishment of the declining numbers of mitochondria in their bodies were long-term calorie restriction or exhaustive physical activity—difficult or impractical for most aging people. Now PQQoffers a viable alternative: PQQ(pyrroloquinoline quinone) promotes spontaneous production of new mitochondria.In fact, PQQ promotes youthful cellular function in three distinct ways:Promotes mitochondrial biogenesis.PQQ activates genes that promote the formation of fresh mitochondria.It also beneficially interacts with genes directly involved in mitochondrial health. These same genes support healthy body weight, normal fat and sugar metabolism and youthful cellular proliferation.Mitochondrial defense.Mitochondria possess their own DNA, distinct from those contained in the cell nucleus. Unfortunately, compared to nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA are relatively unprotected—and yet situated at the source of both energy and free-radical production. PQQ’s antioxidant potency and favorable gene-expression profile powerfully boost mitochondrial defense.Antioxidant power. PQQ is a potent antioxidant. Its extraordinary molecular stability enables it to facilitate thousands of antioxidant reactions in the mitochondria—without breaking down—for maximum antioxidant and bioenergetic support.PQQ is an essential nutrient, meaning that your body cannot make it on its own. A wealth of research demonstrates that—alone and especially in combination with CoQ10—its unique nutritional profile supports heart health and brain function.This should be no surprise, given how much energy these vital organs need.Life Extension has identified a purified, highly potent form of PQQ from Japan that is produced through a unique fermentation process. The result is some of the highest quality PQQ available today.Serving Size:1 Softgel Servings per Container:30Amount per Serving:Ubiquinol (as Kaneka QH Ubiquinol)100 mgPrimaVie Shilajit fulvic acid complex100 mgBioPQQ Pyrroloquinoline quinone disodium salt10 mgOther Ingredients:Medium chain triglycerides oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, sunflower lecithin, annatto color, beeswax, rosemary extract.",3.75E1,459,,

2067,,Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™,"Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy. Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie® shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain,2 liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.3,4CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage.1 Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.Ratings based on results of the 2019 ConsumerLab.com Survey of Supplement Users. www.consumerlab.com/survey2019.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingCalories10Calories from Fat10Total Fat1 gUbiquinol (as Kaneka Ubiquinol™)200 mgPrimaVie® Shilajit fulvic acid complex200 mgOther ingredients: sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, beeswax, purified water, annatto color.Non-GMOPrimaVie® is a registered trademark of Natreon, Inc.

2177,,Crucial 8GB DDR3L 1600MHz Dual Rank ECC Unbuffered Dimm,"Crucial 240-pin DIMMs are used in DDR3 memory for desktop computers. DDR3 is the latest generation of memory with an improved architecture that allows it to transmit data more quickly.A dual inline memory module (DIMM) consists of a number of memory components (usually black) that are attached to a printed circuit board (usually green). The gold pins on the bottom of the DIMM provide a connection between the module and a socket on a larger printed circuit board. The pins on the front and back of a DIMM are not connected to each other.Each 240-pin DIMM provides a 64-bit data path (72-bit for ECC or registered or Fully Buffered modules). (The Ballistix™ and Ballistix Tracer™ high-performance memory do not come in 72-bit or registered modules.)To use DDR3 memory,your system motherboard must have 240-pin DIMM slots and a DDR3-enabled chipset. This is because a DDR3 SDRAM DIMM will not fit into a standard DDR2 DIMM socket or a DDR DIMM socket.The number of black components on a 240-pin DIMM can vary,but it always has 120 pins on the front and 120 pins on the back,for a total of 240. 240-pin DIMMs are approximately 5.25 inches long and 1.18 inches high,though the heights can vary. While 240-pin DDR3 DIMMS,240-pin DDR2 DIMMs,184-pin DDR DIMMs,and 168-pin DIMMs are approximately the same size,240-pin DIMMs and 184-pin DIMMs have only one notch within the row of pins.Product Highlights1600MHz DDR3L SDRAMVery Low ProfileCAS Latency_ CL11UDIMM DR x8 ECC 240 pin Form FactorVoltage: 1.35VLimited Lifetime WarrantyLimited Lifetime",2.644E3,333,,

SRAM has added elastomer rings between every cog to provide a 'bed' where the plates of the chain interface with the cog. These elastomer StealthRings make for whisper-quiet operation. It's light, too, with the small 11T cog separate, and the remaining 9 cogs milled from a solid block of tool-grade steel pressed onto a single aluminium cog (the largest one).

2204,,Blackmagic Design ATEM 2 M/E Production Studio 4K SWATEMPSW2ME4K,"Key FeaturesSupports NTSC/PAL/HD/UltraHD 4K @ 10-bitSupports 4K Resolution Over SDI or HDMI20 x 6G-SDI & 1 x HDMI InputsTri-Sync/Blackburst Ref. Sync InputTheATEM 2 M/E Production Studio 4KfromBlackmagic Designis a live event multi camera production switcher with 20 video inputs built into a 2RU chassis. Supporting NTSC/PAL/HD and Ultra HD 4K (3840x2160) video formats, the switcher connects to a wide range of cameras and sources, delivering a single program stream in SD, HD, or Ultra HD video. All this is done live and in real time with no rendering required. The switcher features a reference video input for synchronizing the switcher to other equipment using tri-level or blackburst sync. Each input also features its own frame synchronizer, which allows you to use cameras that do not feature Genlock as well as input video from computer sources.The switcher provides 20 6G-SDI video inputs and one 4K HDMI input, which shares a channel with one of the 6G-SDI inputs. Outputs include three 6G-SDI Program outputs, one HDMI Program output, six 6G-SDI auxiliary outputs. All inputs and outputs are SD/HD/UHD switchable, with the exception of dedicated down-converted HD Program output for monitoring UHD footage on an SDI-equipped HD monitor. Two independent multi-view outputs are available, in both SDI and HDMI, so you can monitor up to 16 cameras across two screens.The switcher features luma and chroma keyers for real time effects and composites in Ultra HD, with 10-bit processing. Two downstream keyers allow you to use two graphics/logos/titles/lower thirds from up to twenty stored graphics in a wide variety of formats. Additionally, the switcher features a built-in SuperSource layer switcher which, in addition to the two full M/E's, keyers and DVE, provides an additional four independent DVE channels letting you re-size and position live cameras, video replays, broadcast graphics, and more.A built-in 22-input audio mixer handles the embedded HDMI and SDI audio from the 20 active video inputs as well as audio from the balanced or unbalanced analog audio inputs to provide you flexibility and creative audio options. Audio output is embedded in the SDI and HDMI stream, as well as available via balanced audio outputs. The control panels connect via the Ethernet port and provide control all the features of the switcher. Illuminated front panel buttons on the switcher allow you to locally select the aux output, while a 2-inch LCD screen built into the front of the unit allows you to see the aux output for instant confirmation of the correct output.Either a Mac or PC running the included ATEM software controls the switcher's operation and settings. For those who like the feel of a physical control panel, the optional ATEM 1 M/E and 2 M/E Broadcast Panels can be used.VideoThe ATEM 2 M/E Production Studio 4K switcher supports 4K Ultra HD video (3840 x 2160), which is four times the resolution of Full HD. The video format is set by the user and must be the same across each input, as the switcher cannot scale different input formats to match the project format.The switcher features 20 single link 6G-SDI and one HDMI 4K input, which allows you to connect SD/HD/Ultra HD and computer-based signals to the switcher. However, the HDMI input is shared with one of the SDI inputs, so you can only have a maximum of 20 inputs.The switcher takes reference video in for sync timing, either blackburst or tri-level sync, so that it can interface with other post production equipment.Each input incorporates its own frame synchronizer, which enables you to use cameras that do not have genlock capability or to input computer sources such as Keynote or PowerPoint Presentations.AudioThe switcher includes a built-in audio mixer for mixing and balancing embedded audio from all 20 video inputs as well as the two audio inputs, each with two channel support. This lets you manually mix sources or you can set mixer inputs to \""audio follow video\"" so your audio crossfades as you switch between sources.Video OutputsThe switcher features two program outputs for the final video, delivering SD/HD/Ultra HD via three 6G-SDI port and one HDMI 4K connector.The switcher features six SDI auxiliary outputs capable of delivering the program out feed with or without the downstream keyer effects in SD, HD and Ultra HD. Control of the Aux output is by front mounted panel buttons, and built-in LCD screen for immediate confirmation of the Aux output.Two independent multi-view outputs available via an SDI or HDMI connectors so you can see up to 16 cameras across two screens.EffectsTransitionsThe ATEM 2 M/E Production Studio 4K switcher features four built-in transitions.Cut:ATEM instantly changes from current program source to the preview source precisely at the moment you hit the button. Cuts can be performed by directly selecting sources on the program bus or more commonly by pressing the cut button to transition to the next source lined up on the preview bus.Mix:Dissolves from one image to another. You can program a pre-set transition rate, or use the included software control panel or available hardware panels to manually transition from one shot to another.Dip:Is similar to the mix/dissolve, except it first it transitions to a color/graphic or video source and then to the next shot.Wipe patterns:With 18 built-in wipe patterns, you can create over 100 different transitions, and the patterns can be inverted or softened and you can customize the color of the border. You can also insert up to three live video streams into the borders.Key Frameable TransitionsThe built-in DVE allows you to create key frame based DVE moves, flying graphics and animated stingers.KeyersThe switcher features four upstream keyers and a DVE, allowing you to layer live video, title, graphics and animation over live video. You can choose from chroma, luma, linear, and pattern keys at Ultra HD resolution with 10-bit processing.Two downstream keyers allow you to add graphics, lower thirds, titles and logos for a polished live production.The DVE allows you to create a picture-in-picture effect.Control InterfaceThe switcher features back lit front panel control buttons for manual control.The switcher uses an Ethernet connection to interface with control surfaces such as the optional ATEM 1 M/E and 2 M/E Broadcast Panels.You can also control the switcher by using the included ATEM Software Control software from a Mac or Windows computer over Ethernet. You can control all production settings of the switcher as well as directly import graphics from your computer into the switcher's media pool.You set the format for each project you are working on, from SD to HD to Ultra HD, selecting resolution and frame rate. This is accomplished by using either the included software for Mac/PC or via the ATEM 1 M/E or ATEM 2 M/E Broadcast Panel.Using the Ethernet port on the switcher allows you to connect control surfaces directly to the switcher or you can control the switcher across a network.The switcher features a USB port that is used for software updates and to set the switcher's chassis IP address, which can only be done by using a computer running the ATEM Switcher Utility connected to the switcher's USB port.Rack MountThe switcher is 2RU in height and has built-in rack mount ears for mounting in a production road case or in a post production facility.In the BoxBlackmagic Design ATEM 2 M/E Production Studio 4KCD-ROM with ATEM Software Control PanelLimited 1-Year Warranty",3995.00,1467,,

Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with a highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, which is shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health and help promote youthful cellular energy production.Your heart cells need CoQ10—but so do your other organs. That’s why CoQ10 is also highly concentrated in your brain, liver and kidneys.CoQ10 BenefitsPromotes cellular energy production, especially in the high-energy organs such as the brain, the liver, kidneys & the heartContains ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10 augmented with PrimaVie® shilajit to promote mitochondrial CoQ10 absorption to support greater cellular energy outputProvides powerful cardiovascular & antioxidant supportOffers a way to offset natural CoQ10 depletion over timeCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level. Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys and your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in the body decrease over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol The traditional ubiquinone form of CoQ10 is difficult for the body to absorb. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system shown to absorb up to 8 times better than ubiquinone. In people taking this form of ubiquinol, high levels of plasma CoQ10 can be achieved in only four weeks.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit has been shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy. When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit doubles levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form and promotes greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.CoQ10 and agingIn a pre-clinical model, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared with ubiquinone.21 In another pre-clinical study, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Do your part for a healthy heartSuper Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is a powerful formula for heart health and youthful cellular energy support.

Compose your photos quickly with the 190x aluminum 3-section tripod with XPRO Fluid head. The head supports over 8 lbs of camera and accessories. The head provides two fluid drag settings to smooth your tilts in one continuous movement. The kit provides you freedom when shooting like you've never experienced. With this tripod with head, you'll be able to capture ultra-low perspectives, and it's all thanks to the ground level adapter, housed in the top casting of the tripod. Discover your potential and shoot like never before. The Quick Power Lock (QPL) also blocks and unblocks each leg, which means this tripod is incredibly easy to set up and adjust. Better still, the QPL levers' powerful locking mechanism of each leg section will ensure your tripod is as stable as possible. You'll also benefit from a comfortable, strong, single-handed grip - perfect when you're shooting those ultra-low angles from awkward positions. When you need to shoot quickly, you can release each leg section in one single movement to save time. All in all, the 190x aluminium 3-section tripod provides a level of shooting freedom and stability that is a substantial improvement on older, traditional tripods. If you're keen to showcase your video skills, this tripod makes a great travel companion thanks to its lightweight 0.7kg design and high-quality aluminium body and polymer adapter. Choose from two fluidity levels – hard and soft – and customise it to your type of gear and movement. Each leg angle of the 190x aluminium 3-section tripod can be independently and solidly set thanks to the intuitive and ergonomic leg angle selectors, giving you more positioning freedom. Easily add an accessory such as a flash or LED light via the Easy Link and an extending arm, and turn your tripod into a flexible and practical mobile studio. The 190x tripod and fluid head are made in Italy by Manfrotto.",349.99,1438,,

This new lens embodies the concept of our new Art lenses.Our Art line delivers high-level artistic qualitySigma is organizing all its interchangeable lenses into three product lines; Contemporary, Art and Sports. Designed with a focus on sophisticated optical performance and abundant expressive power, our Art line delivers high-level artistic expression. Developed with the maximum emphasis on artistic touch, our Art line lenses are designed to meet the expectations of users who value a creative, dramatic outcome above compactness and multifunction. Along with landscapes, portraits, still-life, close-up and casual snaps, they're perfect for the kind of photography that unleashes the inner artist. Ideal for studio photography, they offer just as much expressive scope when capturing architecture, starry skies, underwater shots and many other scenes. The SIGMA 35mm F1.4 DG HSM is the first lens from the Art line.Compensate for color aberration to ensure unsurpassed expressive performanceAberration is an important factor for the lens performance. To actualize a high-performance lens, one of the essential elements is aberration correction. When it comes to aberration, there are chromatic aberration of magnification and axial chromatic aberration. It is possible to correct the chromatic aberration of magnification in photo-editing software whereas axial chromatic aberration cannot be corrected afterwards. This lens incorporates FLD (\""F\"" Low Dispersion) glass elements, which have performance equal to fluorite, and SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass elements, and by optimizing the power alignment of the lens, both types of aberration have been corrected. The lens achieves ultra-high image quality through the entire focusing range. Also, by appropriate alignment of aspheric lenses, astigmatism and field curvature are corrected. The result is superior optimum resolution even in peripheral areas.Large maximum aperture of F1.4In 2005, Sigma released a lens that has aperture value F1.4 designed for digital SLRs, \""SIGMA 30mm F1.4 EX DC HSM\"". Since then, we have produced high-performance lenses by incorporating the latest optical technique, such as the standard lens designed for a full size image sensor, the SIGMA 50mm F1.4 EX DG HSM and the medium telephoto lens with large aperture, SIGMA 85mm F1.4 EX DG HSM. This lens, SIGMA 35mm F1.4 DG HSM, is our fourth lens that achieves extraordinary expressive power at the aperture value at F1.4. For wide angle photography, it ensures excellent brightness with the large F1.4 aperture and a beautiful bokeh effect.Attractive blur effectCorrection of coma aberration enabled less blur on a point light source in peripheral areas, and the function is best used for astrophotography and illuminations. It is also possible to create an attractive blur to the out of focus areas. The aspheric lens elements used as the first lens have secured peripheral brightness while correcting distortion. The rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur to the out-of-focus areas of the image.Floating inner focusing systemThis system compensates for astigmatic aberration and spherical aberration and provides extremely high optical performance for close-up photos.Flare and ghosting conscious designIn order to achieve high rendering on this flagship lens, flare and ghosting were thoroughly measured from an early stage to establish an optical design which is resistant to strong incident light such as backlight. The Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting and provides sharp and high contrast images even in backlit conditions.Hyper Sonic MotorThe HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) ensures high speed and quiet AF as well as full-time manual focus override by rotation of the focus ring. With the enhanced AF algorithm, smoother AF is achieved.Brass made bayonet mountThis lens incorporates a brass made bayonet mount which has both high accuracy and durability. A special treatment to reinforce its strength is applied to the surface giving it greater strength and making it highly resistant to long-term use.Ease of useThe new product lines incorporate rubber for the attachment part of the provided lens hood. For better usability, the design of the lens cap and AF/MF changeover switch have been improved. In order to ensure high accuracy of the product, all metallic parts and the new compound material, TSC (Thermally Stable Composite), which has high affinity to metal parts, are housed internally.Newly developed \""USB DOCK\"" exclusively for new product linesBased on these new lines, we have developed special software (SIGMA Optimization Pro) that can update the lens firmware and adjust parameters such as focus.Evaluation with Sigma's own MTF measuring system \""A1\""We used to measure lens performance with MTF measuring system using conventional sensors. However, we've now developed our own proprietary MTF (modulation transfer function) measuring system (A1) using 46-megapixel Foveon direct image sensors. Even previously undetectable high-frequency details are now within the scope of our quality control inspections. The SIGMA 35mm F1.4 DG HSM will all be checked using this \""A1\"" before they are shipped.",524,55,,

Empowered by the Z system's larger mount, shorter flange distance and cutting-edge imaging advancements, the NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/4 S delivers uncanny sharpness, vibrance and even lighting across the entire frame. A constant f/4 max aperture maintains consistent exposure at any zoom setting, record smooth zoom transitions with even lighting across the entire sequence. A new optical formula achieves faithful colour reproduction with minimal axial/lateral chromatic aberration and virtually zero sagittal coma flare, even at 24mm. The larger Z Mount enables epic definition and resolution from the centre of the frame to the edges, no need to stop this lens down. New Dual Detect 5 Axis VR is achieved by using the Z cameras' superior in-camera image stabilization system for up to 5 stops of pitch, roll, yaw, X and Y shake correction. The NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/4 S silent stepping is possible thanks to the new ultra-quiet stepping motor (STM) designed specifically for the new Z Mount size the new STM powers fast, near-silent AF and aperture adjustments.

2592,,Sony Alpha a7S III FE Mirrorless Camera Body,"Optimized video, optimized sensitivity, optimized speed, the Sony Alpha a7S III raises the bar for what a full-frame mirrorless camera is capable of. A revised 12.1MP Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor and updated BIONZ XR image processor offer faster performance, improved noise reduction, and a wider dynamic range, along with UHD 4K 120p video recording and internal 10-bit 4:2:2 sampling.Video is the primary application of the a7S III, and improvements to the sensor and processor enable faster readout speeds and greatly reduced rolling shutter, along with high-bitrate internal recording, 16-bit raw output via the full-size HDMI port, and flexible control over motion with variable frame rate selection. The a7S III also does away with recording time limits and incorporates HLG for direct HDR production as well as S-Log2/S-Log3 gamma profiles for advanced HDR production with editing.The updated sensor design also brings improved autofocus performance via 759 phase-detection points, which offer intelligent subject tracking and Real-time Eye AF to ensure critical focus on moving subjects in all recording modes. The sensor and BIONZ XR processor also facilitate impressive sensitivity, with an expanded range from ISO 40-409600, as well as fast 10 fps continuous shooting for up to 1000 consecutive raw frames. Additionally, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift image stabilization is available, too, which minimizes the appearance of camera shake by up to 5.5 stops.Complementing the imaging assets, Sony has also made some changes to the a7S III's physical design, including a rear LCD with a side-open articulating design and an impressive 9.44m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder. The camera's menu system has also been updated for more intuitive navigation and the body design helps to promote better heat dissipation for improved continuous recording capabilities. Additionally, dual memory card slots both support working with CFexpress Type A or SD UHS-II memory cards for flexible and high-speed file storage.12.1MP Exmor RS BSI CMOS Sensor and BIONZ XR Image ProcessorA redesigned 12.1MP full-frame CMOS sensor now features a back-illuminated Exmor RS design in order to achieve improved clarity and reduced noise along with the expectedly impressive sensitivity, from ISO 80-102400 with an extended ISO 40-409600 range. The updated sensor design also yields 2x faster readout speeds than previous generations and, when coupled with the revised BIONZ XR image processor, greatly reduces rolling shutter by 3x and up to 8x faster processing and overall camera handling. The sensor and processor combination also helps to achieve a wide dynamic range, of up to approximately 14 stops for stills and 15 stops for video, and 10 fps continuous shooting for up to 1000 uncompressed raw files for stills.UHD 4K 120p Video, 10-Bit 4:2:2 Internal RecordingRecording up to UHD 4K is possible with frame rates up to 120p, using full 1:1 pixel readout without binning. Internal 10-bit 4:2:2 sampling is also possible in all recording modes and, if recording externally via the full-size HDMI A port, 16-bit raw output is also possible for even greater tonal reproduction and post-production flexibility. Additionally, two codecs have also been developed: XAVC HS, which uses HEVC/H.265 encoding to retain more detail at smaller bitrates, and XAVC S-I, which is an intraframe codec for consistent performance and quality at bitrates up to 600 Mb/s.The high-speed, 120 fps recording also enables 4x and 5x slow-motion movie recording with the frame rate playback set to either 30p or 24p or, if moving down to Full HD resolution, an effective 240p frame rate is also available for even greater motion control. Additionally, suiting long-form recording, the a7S III does not have any recording time limits to allow for unlimited clip lengths. The camera's physical design also features an improved heat-dissipating structure to promote longer possible recording times, up to an approximate 60-minute recording time at 4K60p.Affording extensive customizable color and gamma controls, the a7S III allows users to adjust the gamma, black level, knee, color level, and more. Also, users can use the same S-Log2 Gamma Curve that is found on high end Sony Cinema cameras that squeezes up to 1300% more dynamic range into the video signal then traditional REC709, for increased post-production flexibility. HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) support is also available, along with the BT.2020 color space, for recording within a wide color gamut and, in addition to S-Log2, S-Log3 is also available for producing a 15+-stop dynamic range with increased grading control in the shadow to mid-tone regions of the image.Fast Hybrid AF SystemCovering 92% of the image area, a Fast Hybrid AF system incorporates 759 phase-detection points along with 425 contrast-detection areas for quick and precise focusing in a variety of lighting conditions with sensitivity down to -6 EV. This focusing system is available for use in all recording modes, to benefit both video and stills applications. Additionally, it is able to lock onto subjects quickly and can use Real-time Tracking for AI-based tracking on moving subjects or touch tracking for manual selection of the subject. Real-time Eye AF, suitable for both humans and animals, also ensures critical sharpness when shooting portraits. Helping to fine-tune how the focusing system performs, seven-step AF transition speed and five-step AF subject shift sensitivity controls let you refine how quickly focus shifts from point to point and how smoothly focusing shifts occur.5-Axis SteadyShot INSIDE Image StabilizationThe a7S III incorporates an enhanced 5.5-stop effective 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization system, which compensates for five different types of camera shake encountered during handheld shooting of stills and video. This allows users to confidently use any lens, even adapted lenses, for critical imaging without encountering blur from camera shake.For long focal lengths, the system will correct for pitch and yaw adjustments. Macro and high-magnification imagery, on the other hand, will benefit from the inclusion of horizontal and vertical shift compensation. All shooting styles will get usage out of the roll compensation. All 5 axes of stabilization will function at all times, even when used with third-party lenses and adapters or lenses with built-in optical stabilization.Additionally, specifically for video, there is also an Active IS mode that adds electronic stabilization for even smoother footage straight out of camera.Body Design and ConnectivityAn impressive QXGA OLED Tru-Finder EVF features a high 9.44m-dot resolution and 0.9x magnification for exceptionally bright, clear, and detailed eye-level viewing. This viewfinder has a dedicated 120 fps High Quality setting for smooth motion rendering and the finder's physical design has a long 25mm eye point, 41° field of view, and features a fluorine coating on the outermost viewfinder element to benefit cleaning.A first for a7-series cameras, a side-opening 3.0\"" 1.44m-dot vari-angle articulating screen benefits working from high and low angles as well as a front-facing position for vlogging or other self-recording needs. This LCD is a touchscreen, too, for intuitive shooting control and menu navigation.Dual memory card slots both accept either CFexpress Type A or SD-type memory cards. The dual slot design allows for flexible file saving and handling and can be configured to partition file types or can be used for overflow recording. Additionally, both of the card slots are rated to support UHS-II memory cards for faster transfer speeds.Redesigned menu structure is more intuitive and complements having different workflows and settings selections for movie recording and stills shooting. The menu system also works in conjunction with the touchscreen design of the rear LCD.Magnesium alloy chassis assures rigidity, durability, and stability while remaining lightweight. The lens mount has also been improved to better support heavy lenses, and the grip rigidity has been improved for more comfortable hand-holding.Extensive weather-sealing, including enhanced sealing around the battery cover, terminal cover, and chassis joints, has been employed to resist dust and moisture for reliable operation in harsh weather conditions.Accepts the high-capacity NP-FZ100 rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which provides approximately 510 shots/80 minutes of recording per charge when using the viewfinder or 600 shots/95 minutes of recording per charge when using the rear LCD.Full-size HDMI A port offers a more reliable connection when working with external recorders.A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port has been added, in addition to a micro-USB port, for faster, more reliable tethering support.

This means that you'll be able to capture sharp, clear handheld images, even in low light. What's more, VR modes are specifically designed for Sports & Action and Tripod Shooting to deliver specialized image stabilization matching your situation.

2754,,GIGABYTE RTX 2080 SUPER GAMING OC 8G,"WINDFORCE 3X COOLING SYSTEMThe WINDFORCE 3X cooling system features 3x 82mm unique blade fans, alternate spinning fan, 6 composite copper heat pipes, heat-pipe direct touch and 3D active fan functionality, together delivering an effective heat dissipation capacity for higher performance at lower temperatures.ALTERNATE SPINNINGThe GIGABYTE patent “Alternate Spinning” is the only solution that can solve the turbulent airflow of three fans. The biggest problem with the three fans is turbulence. Since the fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the middle fan in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.UNIQUE BLADE FANThe airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing the airflow.3D ACTIVE FANThe 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle.HEAT PIPES DIRECT TOUCHThe shape of the pure copper heat pipe maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU, enhancing heat transfer. The heat pipe also covers the VRAM through a large metal plate contact to ensure proper cooling.COMPOSITE HEAT-PIPEThe composite heat-pipe combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently manage the heat transfer between two solid interfaces which increases cooling capacity.GAME IN STYLERGB FUSION 2.0With 16.7M customizable color options and numerous lighting effects, you can choose lighting effects or synchronize with other AORUS devices.EXTREME DURABILITY AND OVERCLOCKINGThe graphics card uses the better power phase design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature, and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET, plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors, to provide excellent performance and longer system life.PROTECTION METAL BACK PLATEThe metal back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.POWER INDICATORSThe smart power LED indicator alerts the player when any PCI-E power supply is abnormal.NVIDIA NVLINK TM SUPPORTSupport for NVIDIA NVLinkTM (NVIDIA SLI) technology, which combines 2 identical GPUs with an GeForce RTX NVLink Bridge to deliver the ultimate experience in 4K gaming or VR gaming.

WD Red = NAS.Desktop hard drives are designed for optimum performance and reliability in a desktop personal computer. Although they are an affordable alternative to enterprise-class drives, desktop drives have a higher level of risk for potential data loss and failure in an always-on RAID configured NAS system. Specific issues that you may experience using desktop drives in a NAS or RAID environment include:Compatibility: Desktop hard drives are not always tested for compatibility in NAS and can present problems during integration.Reliability: Most desktop drives are not designed for the high operating temperatures or for 24x7 operating environments making them less reliable when used in a NAS system.Error recovery controls: Desktop drives are not traditionally designed for RAID environments and have controls that prevent the RAID controller from assisting in the event of an error which can cause the hard drive to drop off the RAID after a period of time. Rebuilding a RAID often requires several hours and can have a significant impact on downtime and productivity.Noise and vibration: Typically designed for single drive applications, average desktop drives are not optimized for multi-drive systems which have higher noise and vibration levels. When these drives are added to a NAS, the additional vibration can reduce the reliability and life span of the drive.Beyond the Desktop with NASwareWD Red drives include WD's exclusive NASware technology that addresses many of the challenges a traditional desktop hard drive has in a NAS system. WD works directly with our partners to test compatibility and reduce our customer's guess work as to which drive is right for their NAS system. Designed to deliver a better customer experience in small NAS systems, this innovative firmware finely balances the most important attributes of performance, power, and reliability in multiple drive environments. The unique algorithms in NASware optimize power and performance without compromising on the attributes that NAS-system owners value.Save power and moneyNASware further improves drive reliability and protects your data in the event of a power loss or disruption. Optimized power usage of WD Red drives results in significant power savings and lower hard drive operating temperatures within a small NAS environment, improving the overall reliability and performance of the drive and reduces the NAS cost of ownership.Intelligent Error RecoveryWith built in intelligent error recovery controls, NASware also prevents hard drives from being dropped off the RAID due to extended error recovery. This feature provides more availability and less down time when rebuilding the RAID.Command CompletionTo further improve reliability, NASware minimizes the data corruption or loss in the event of an unexpected power loss by completing the command in process before shutting down.Important Features for System IntegratorsIn addition to features that make WD Red™ drives perfect for populating or upgrading NAS systems, NASware brings features that system integrators need when building specialized NAS systems.Streaming Support- NASware provides built-in compatibility with the ATA Streaming Feature Set, which is important for AV storage applications such as Windows Media Center.SMART Command Transport (SCT) support- NASware allows monitoring and measuring of drive performance via the SMART command set. SMART can return data like thermal profiles, drive access statistics and more. NASware also delivers temperature accuracy within 1°C.Power Management Support- Enables optimized power usage within the NAS system and protects your data in the event of a power loss or disruption.BIC Performance- Optimized seek to provide BIC performance while reducing the power and acoustics.",184.95,2432,,

This year, the collection celebrates 25 years with a full makeover from the inside out. The original design and ocean spirit are still there, but now with advanced materials and updates in every model.Now sized at 42 mm, every design detail has been rethought, including a new ceramic bezel with the diving scale in Ceragold&trade; or white enamel. Inside, the watches include the Master Chronometer Calibre 8800, instantly taking the collection into a higher realm of precision, performance and magnetic resistance.The sleek dials are made from ceramic and are available in black, blue or PVD chrome colour. The popular wave pattern has been reintroduced (now laser-engraved) and the indexes have been raised and filled with Super-LumiNova. Even the skeleton hands have been subtly reshaped.One of the Diver 300M's most important details has always been its helium escape valve. For the new models, the valve has been given a conical shape and has been patented by OMEGA with an ingenious technology that allows it to be operated underwater.Turning the watch over reveals a wave-patterned edge on the caseback, as well as sapphire crystal, through which you can see the METAS-approved Master Chronometer Calibre 8800.",10200,1720,,

Pocket spring mattresses conform to your natural body shape and distributes pressure on your body more evenly, resulting in a more comfortable and restful sleep.CARE INSTRUCTIONSDO NOT MACHINE WASHDO NOT BLEACHDO NOT IRONDO NOT DRYCLEANDO NOT SATURATE WITH WATER OR OTHER CLEANING LIQUIDSTREAT SPILLS WITH A CLOTH AND DRY WITH BLOW DRYERMAY BE SPOT CLEANED WITH WATER OR SOAPROTATE MATTRESS REGULARLYVACUUM USING LOW SUCTIONFeaturesGiselle bedding - Independent pocket spring mattress21cm thicknessSoft quilting layer to optimise comfortHypo-allergenic material - dust mite & mould resistantNo turn technology - no need to turn the mattress!Size: SingleFirmness: 5.0 / mediumNumber of coils: 660Dimensions: 190 x 91 x 21cmVacuum packaging: item will expand to its normal shape within 1 day after unpackagingPackage Contents1 x Pocket Spring Mattress",134.75,1746,,

(66 mm by 30 mm)In short, 204-pin small outline dual inline memory modules (SODIMMs) are the form factor used to provide DDR3 memory modules for notebook computers and other small form factor computing platforms. 204-pin SODIMMs are currently available in PC3-8500 (DDR3 1066MHz) and PC3-10600 (DDR3 1333MHz) speeds.To use DDR3 memory, your system must have both a 204-pin SODIMM slot and a chipset that supports DDR3 memory. A DDR3 SODIMM will not fit into DDR2 or DDR memory sockets. (Information about which memory technology your system uses is included in the Crucial Memory Advisor™ tool.)SODIMMs are smaller and thinner than regular DIMMs, and the 204-pin SODIMM PCBs are always ~2.6 inches long and are usually around 1.18 inches high (though the heights can vary slightly). They consist of a number of memory components (usually black) that are attached to a printed circuit board (usually green). The number of memory components on a 204-pin SODIMM’s printed circuit board (PCB) can vary, but the PCB will always have 102 pins on the front and the back both, for a total of 204 pins. The gold pins on the bottom of the SODIMM provide the connection between the memory module and the memory socket.SpecificationECC: NON-ECCForm Factor: SODIMMModule Size: 4GBKit Qty: 1Speed: 1600 MT/STracer: FalseVoltage: 1.35VDIMM Type: UnbufferedBullet Features: Increases system performanceWarranty: Limited LifetimeSpecs: DDR3 PC3-12800 • CL=11 • Unbuffered • NON-ECC • DDR3-1600 • 1.35V",943.00,1766,,

Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with a highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, which is shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health and help promote youthful cellular energy production.Your heart cells need CoQ10—but so do your other organs. That’s why CoQ10 is also highly concentrated in your brain, liver and kidneys.CoQ10 BenefitsPromotes cellular energy production, especially in the high-energy organs such as the brain, the liver, kidneys & the heartContains ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10 augmented with PrimaVie® shilajit to promote mitochondrial CoQ10 absorption to support greater cellular energy outputProvides powerful cardiovascular & antioxidant supportOffers a way to offset natural CoQ10 depletion over timeCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level. Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys and your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage.Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in the body decrease over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinolThe traditional ubiquinone form of CoQ10 is difficult for the body to absorb. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system shown to absorb up to 8 times better than ubiquinone. In people taking this form of ubiquinol, high levels of plasma CoQ10 can be achieved in only four weeks.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit has been shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy. When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit doubles levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form and promotes greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.CoQ10 and agingIn a pre-clinical model, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared with ubiquinone. In another pre-clinical study, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Do your part for a healthy heartSuper Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is a powerful formula for heart health and youthful cellular energy support.

3060,,Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG HSM Art Lens [Nikon],"The Nikon F mount Sigma 50mm f/1.4 DG HSM Lens is a fast standard-length prime designed to achieve high optical performance through the incorporation of both three Special Low Dispersion glass elements and one molded glass aspherical element. These elements, coupled with an advanced optical design, work to minimize sagittal coma flare and chromatic aberrations in order to provide high image sharpness and clarity. The lens' large diameter and floating system also help to correct for vignetting to ensure maintained peripheral brightness. A Super Multi Coating has been applied to lens elements, too, to reduce flare and ghosting for higher contrast and color fidelity.A Hyper Sonic AF Motor, along with an optimized AF algorithm, produces quiet, smooth, and fast autofocus performance that benefits this lens' use in a wide variety of situations. This AF motor also permits full-time manual focusing control for refined precision by simply turning the focus ring at any time.Sigma Global Vision - ArtAs part of the Art line within Sigma's Global Vision series, this lens' is designed to achieve truly notable optical performance and is ideally suited for creative and artistic applications.Molded Glass Aspherical ElementThis lens has been designed using an advanced optical structure to achieve both high resolution and sharpness along with an aesthetic out-of-focus quality for greater subject separation. A molded glass aspherical element corrects for sagittal coma flare and enables full use of the fast f/1.4 maximum aperture with maintained sharpness and clarity. This design also works to minimize vignetting, color blur, and other distortions help to produce natural and pleasing bokeh for selective focus and shallow depth of field techniques. By reducing these aberrations, this lens is also well-suited to astrophotography or other situations with point-light sources due to its ability to suppress blur near the edges of the frame.Special Low Dispersion Glass ElementsThree SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass elements have been incorporated within the lens design to correct for axial chromatic aberration throughout the entire focusing range. This helps to ensure maintained image sharpness, clarity, and contrast regardless of focus point or aperture setting.Large Diameter LensIn designing the lens with a large 85.4mm diameter, and placing the widest elements within the front group, greater peripheral brightness is more easily attained when working with larger apertures. This design also lends itself to minimizing vignetting throughout the aperture range for greater clarity and detail across the image frame.Super Multi-Layer CoatingA Super Multi-Layer Coating has been applied to lens elements in order to minimize lens flare and ghosting and contribute to producing contrast-rich and color-neutral imagery, even in backlit conditions.Floating SystemBy employing a floating system, the distance between glass elements is adjusted during focusing in order to limit the amount of lens movement required when shooting. This floating system helps to realize a minimum focusing distance of 1.3' with a maximum magnification of 1:5.6. Additionally, this design also contributes to high detail rendering capabilities throughout the entire focusing range.Hyper Sonic AF MotorThe integrated HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) realizes quick and quiet autofocusing, which is further complemented by an optimized AF algorithm to produce smoother focusing performance. The HSM also permits full-time manual focus control simply by rotating the focus ring at any time.Other Lens FeaturesA rounded nine-blade diaphragm helps to produce an attractive out-of-focus quality.The lens is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite (TSC) material, along with traditional metals, for greater precision and use in wide temperature variations.The outside of the lens barrel is also engraved with the year of production.The bayonet mount is constructed from brass for ensured accuracy and durability.The included lens hood is fitted with a rubber connection for a secure fit.This lens is compatible with the optional Sigma USB Dock for fine-tuning different lens characteristics and updating its firmware.",9.49E2,1772,,

FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens features a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture for consistent performance throughout the zoom range. The optical layout comprises six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, which help to virtually eliminate chromatic aberrations and color fringing for greater clarity and color accuracy. Four aspherical elements are also used to suppress distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness. Also, a Nano-GI coating helps to control ghosting and flare for enhanced contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Complementing the optics is a refined linear motor, which affords quick and quiet autofocus performance, and the lens body is weather-sealed in 11 distinct places to support working in trying environmental conditions. Impressively wide zoom is designed for FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 12-24mm equivalent focal length range. Constant f/2.8 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and excels when working in difficult lighting conditions. Six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity throughout the zoom range. Four aspherical elements control distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating has been applied to lens elements and alters the refractive index between the glass and air in order to better suppress lens flare and ghosting for diagonal incident light. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. The lens body incorporates extensive weather sealing to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions and freezing temperatures as low as 14°F.",1999.95,1902,,

3251,,Canon 55-250mm f/4-5.6 EF-S IS STM Lens,"TheCanon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM Lensis a long-reaching zoom lens that provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 88-400mm, covering portrait-length to telephoto perspectives to suit working with distant subject matter. Greatly benefitting this lens' reach is the incorporation of image stabilization, which works to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to 3.5 shutter speed steps to support handheld use in low-light conditions.An STM stepping focus motor is also integrated into the lens' design to provide smooth, quiet, and fast focusing performance that is ideally-suited to video applications as well as tracking moving subjects. The rear focusing system, high-speed CPU, and an enhanced AF algorithm also contribute to quickened overall AF speeds. Full-time manual focus is also supported to permit fine-tuning of focus even while working in AF modes. Additionally, the front lens section does not rotate during focusing to better facilitate the use of polarizing filters.The optical construction of the lens employs one ultra-low dispersion glass element to help reduce chromatic aberrations and distortion throughout the zoom range while also enhancing contrast and clarity. Optimized lens coatings have also been applied to ensure color fidelity by countering the effects of lens flare and ghosting.Long-reaching zoom lens provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length of 88-400mm, covering portrait-length to telephoto perspectives.Optical image stabilization helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to 3.5 shutter speed steps to benefit shooting handheld in dim lighting and with greater zoom magnifications.The STM stepping focus motor produces near-silent, smooth, and quick autofocus performance that is well-suited to video applications.One ultra-low dispersion element helps to reduce chromatic aberrations and distortion while also contributing to greater image sharpness, contrast, and clarity.Enhanced lens coatings minimize flare and ghosting in order to produce true colors with maintained contrast.A minimum focusing distance of 2.8' throughout the zoom range and a maximum magnification of 0.29x at the telephoto end enables working with close-up subject matter.A seven blade circular aperture helps to produce an aesthetic out-of-focus quality to benefit selective focus and shallow depth of field imagery.",229.99,1963,,

Built for FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless digital cameras, this fast zoom further distinguishes itself with a sophisticated design, highly effective optical image stabilization system, and a Triple Linear Motor AF system for refined focusing performance.In regards to the optical design, this lens incorporates five extra-low dispersion elements and one Super ED element, which reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing for increased clarity and color accuracy. Additionally, a Nano-GI coating has also been applied to elements to alter the refractive index between elements, to minimize surface reflections, and to prevent lens flare and ghosting. Additionally a rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality when working with selective focus techniques.Flexible telephoto zoom is designed for APS-C-format Fujifilm X-mount mirrorless cameras and offers a 76-213mm equivalent focal length range.Constant f/2.8 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and excels when working in difficult lighting conditions.Five extra-low dispersion elements and one Super ED element are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity throughout the zoom range.Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating has been applied to lens elements and alters the refractive index between the glass and air in order to better suppress lens flare and ghosting for diagonal incident light.An HT-EBC (High Transmittance Electron Beam Coating) coating has been applied to the entire surface of each element for controlling ghosting and flare for greater contrast and color accuracy.A Triple Linear Motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas.Complemented by an enhanced gyro sensor and unique series of algorithms, the optical stabilization system minimizes the appearance of camera shake to enable sharper imaging when working with longer focal lengths or slower shutter speeds.The lens body incorporates 20 distinct weather seals to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions and freezing temperatures as low as 14°F.Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contribute to a pleasing out-of-focus quality to benefit the use of selective focus and shallow depth of field techniques.A tripod collar is included for well-balanced mounting and shooting when working from a tripod or monopod.Compatible with optional XF 1.4x TC WR and XF 2x TC WR teleconverters.In the Box","1,599.00",2000,,

3470,,SIGMA 35 mm f/1.4 DG HSM A Standard Prime Lens - for Canon,"The Sigma 35mm f/1.4 DG HSM A Standard Prime Lens is part of the high-performance 'Art Series', featuring superb optics, for professional and serious amateur photographers. Advanced optical design Designed with sophisticated optical performance, the DG HSM A combines complex features, with easy handling. Its 13 element, 11 group construction includes Super-Low Dispersion (SLD) glass and 'F' Low Dispersion (FLD) glass elements, which have performance equal to fluorite. This helps minimize and correct both the chromatic aberration of magnification and axial chromatic aberration to achieve ultra-high quality images. Large maximum aperture Sigma has a strong reputation for producing high-performance lenses by incorporating the latest optical techniques. The f/1.4 DG HSM A achieves extraordinary expressive power with a maximum aperture of f/1.4. Your wide angle photography benefits from excellent brightness even in the poorest light conditions with optimum resolution even in the periphery. HyperSonic Motor The HSM (HyperSonic Motor) ensures fast and quiet autofocus with full-time manual override. The enhanced AF algorithm gives you smoother autofocus which can be overridden anytime by rotating the focus ring. This drives a floating inner focus system that effectively compensates for astigmatic and spherical aberration, designed to maintain high optical performance for all subject distances, including extreme close-up photos. Reduced flare and ghosting Super Multi-Layer Coating is used to reduce flare and ghosting. Combined with an optical design engineered to be resistant to strong incident light, the f/1.4 DG HSM A provides sharp, high contrast images even in backlit conditions. Blur Effect The aperture diaphragm effectively uses 9 rounded blades to create an attractive bokeh effect in the out of focus areas of the image. As a result, you can achieve beautifully expressive photos with artistic peripheral distortion. Easy to use The Sigma 'Art Series' lenses are constructed with rubber for the attachment part of the lens hood allowing for better usability. The f/1.4 DG HSM A also incorporates a brass made bayonet mount which ensures high accuracy and durability. With excellent image quality, professional-grade optics and flawless operation, the Sigma 35mm f/1.4 DG HSM A Standard Prime Lens for Canon delivers on performance at a competitive price.",599,2432,,

3520,,Nikon NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/4 S,"The NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/4 S is a versatile zoom, spanning wide-angle to portrait-length perspectives. Its constant f/4 maximum aperture maintains a consistent exposure throughout the zoom range and also helps to realize a more compact and lightweight alternative to an f/2.8 zoom. In regard to the optical design, a unique aspherical extra-low dispersion element, in addition to three aspherical elements, is used to help reduce chromatic aberrations and distortions throughout the zoom range in order to achieve high image sharpness and clarity. Both Nano Crystal and Super Integrated Coatings have also been applied to control flare and ghosting for greater contrast and color rendering in bright and backlit conditions.Complementing the optics, a stepping motor provides quick, quiet, and precise autofocus performance along with full-time manual focus override to suit both stills and video applications. A programmable control ring can be set for intuitive adjustment over a variety of camera and exposure settings. Additionally, the lens has a button-less retractable barrel to realize a more compact form factor when not in use.",5.3995E2,2432,,

However, the healthy supply of CoQ10 diminishes as we grow older.It is important to keep adequate levels of CoQ10 to help in the proper functioning of the mitochondria, especially in its ability to accommodate cell energy production in the most vital systems of the body such as the heart. CoQ10 also exhibits strong antioxidant properties that help fight not only the harmful effects of free radicals, but also from LDL and DNA oxidation.Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support contains a potent combination of highly absorbable CoQ10 compounds with shilajit, which together produces an unique synergistic effect for healthy cellular energy production.",34.58,2432,,

The long focal length coupled with the f/2.8 maximum aperture is well-suited to isolating subject matter, especially when paired with the short 9.8\"" minimum focusing distance, and a 1:1 life-size magnification is ideal for macro shooting. A Floating Focus System benefits close-up work by using two distinct focusing groups in order to maintain image quality throughout the focus range, and a linear motor ensures quick, quiet autofocus performance. Additionally, a five stop-effective optical image stabilization system complements making sharp imagery by minimizing the appearance of camera shake. In regard to the optical design, this lens employs one aspherical element and four low dispersion elements to realize sharp, clear imagery void of both chromatic and spherical aberrations. A Super EBC coating has also been applied to suppress flare and ghosting when working in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, enabling the lens's use in harsh environments, it is weather-sealed and also features a fluorine coating on the front element to guard against moisture, smudging, and dust. Key Features Short telephoto prime lens is designed for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 122mm equivalent focal length. Macro lens affords a life-size 1:1 magnification ratio along with a 9.8\"" minimum focusing distance for working with close-up subjects. Four extra-low dispersion elements, including one Super ED element, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity. One aspherical element controls distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Floating Focus System employs two distinct groups of focusing elements for faster performance as maintained image quality throughout the focusing range. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. Focus range limiter switch allows you to constrain the focus range to between 9.8\"" to 1.6', 1.6' to infinity, or for the whole 9.8\"" to infinity range for more responsive focusing depending on the distance to your subject. A five stop-effective optical image stabilization system minimizes the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting in low-light conditions and with slower shutter speeds. The lens body is weather-sealed to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions. Additionally, this design also permits working in temperatures as low as 14°F. A fluorine coating has been applied to the front lens element to guard against smudging, moisture, and dust. Rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality. Compatible with optional XF 1.4x TC WR and XF 2x TC WR teleconverters for extending the effective focal length to an equivalent 171mm and 244mm, respectively.",1199.95,2432,,

3836,,Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG HSM Art Lens [Sony FE],"Fast and versatile, the Sony E-mount 50mm f/1.4 DG HSM from Sigma is a normal-length prime designed to achieve high optical performance through the incorporation of both three Special Low Dispersion glass elements and one molded glass aspherical element. These elements, coupled with an advanced optical design, work to minimize sagittal coma flare and chromatic aberrations in order to provide high image sharpness and clarity. The lens' large diameter and floating system also help to correct for vignetting to ensure maintained peripheral brightness. A Super Multi Coating has been applied to lens elements, too, to reduce flare and ghosting for higher contrast and color fidelity. Additionally, making it an ideal lens for portraiture, the bright f/1.4 maximum aperture pairs with a rounded nine-blade diaphragm to benefit selective focus and shallow depth of field imaging with smooth bokeh.Complementing the imaging capabilities, the lens sports a Hyper Sonic Motor to produce quick, smooth, and quiet autofocus performance with full-time manual focus override. The physical design utilizes Thermally Stable Composite material for durability in a wide range of environments, and a brass bayonet mount also offers rigidity and mounting precision.As part of the Art line within Sigma's Global Vision series, this lens is designed to achieve truly notable optical performance and is ideally suited for creative and artistic applications.Prime normal-length lens is designed for full-frame Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras, however it can also be used with APS-C models where it will provide a 75mm equivalent focal length.Bright f/1.4 maximum aperture is well-suited for working in low-light conditions and also provides greater control over the focus position when using shallow depth of field techniques.Three Special Low Dispersion (SLD) elements are featured in the optical design, and help to reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations for improved clarity and color accuracy.One aspherical element reduces distortion and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness and accurate rendering.A Super Multi-Layer Coating has been applied to lens elements in order to minimize lens flare and ghosting and contribute to producing contrast-rich and color-neutral imagery, even in backlit conditions.Nine-blade rounded diaphragm contributes to a smooth and pleasing bokeh quality.The integrated HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) realizes quick and quiet autofocusing, which is further complemented by an optimized AF algorithm to produce smoother focusing performance. The HSM also permits full-time manual focus control simply by rotating the focus ring at any time.The lens is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite (TSC) material, along with traditional metals, for greater precision and use in wide temperature variations.The bayonet mount is constructed from brass for ensured accuracy and durability.Additionally, rubber sealing is incorporated in the mount design to render it dust- and splash-resistant.In the Box",949.00,2432,,

4026,,Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™,"Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy. Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie® shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain,2 liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.3,4CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage.1 Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 100 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.Ratings based on results of the 2019 ConsumerLab.com Survey of Supplement Users. www.consumerlab.com/survey2019.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingCalories5Calories from Fat5Total Fat0.5 gUbiquinol (as Kaneka Ubiquinol™)100 mgPrimaVie® Shilajit fulvic acid complex100 mgOther ingredients: sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, beeswax, sunflower lecithin, annatto color.Non-GMOPrimaVie® is a registered trademark of Natreon, Inc.Q+®, Kaneka Ubiquinol™, and the quality seal™ are registered or pending trademarks of Kaneka Corp.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.WarningsKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSEDo not purchase if outer seal is broken or damaged.When using nutritional supplements, please consult with your physician if you are undergoing treatment for a medical condition or if you are pregnant or lactating.To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-866-280-2852.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.This product is not for use by or sale to persons under the age of 18.

4222,,Sigma 20mm F1.4 DG HSM Art Lens [Nikon],"Truly wide and truly fast, the Nikon F mount 20mm f/1.4 DG HSM Lens is a member of the venerable Art series of Global Vision lenses from Sigma and pairs a sophisticated optical design with a robust physical construction. Comprised of 15 elements in 11 groups, the lens design includes two \""F\"" Low Dispersion (FLD) elements, five Special Low Dispersion (SLD) elements, and two aspherical elements to significantly reduce chromatic and spherical aberrations, as well as limit distortion for clean, sharp, and evenly illuminated imagery. A Super Multi-Layer Coating has also been applied to minimize surface reflections, flare, and ghosting for increased contrast and color accuracy. The wide focal length and consistent image quality make this lens especially suitable for landscape, interior, architectural, and astrophotography applications, while the fast f/1.4 maximum aperture deems it ideal for natural and low-light shooting.Complementing the optical performance is an equally adept Hyper Sonic Motor, which provides fast, smooth, and near-silent autofocus performance. This focusing motor also enables full-time manual focus override at any time just by rotating the focus ring for refined manual control and focusing as close as 10.9\"". The lens barrel is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite material, which supports working in a wide variety of temperatures and conditions, and the lens mount is constructed from brass for long-term durability and mounting accuracy. Additionally, this lens is also compatible with the optional Sigma USB Dock for fine-tuned control over focusing parameters and other lens characteristics.As part of the Art line within Sigma's Global Vision series, this lens' is designed to achieve truly notable optical performance and is ideally suited for creative and artistic applications.Prime wide-angle 20mm f/1.4 lens is designed for FX format Nikon F mount DSLRs, and can also be used with DX models where it will provide a 30mm equivalent focal length.Fast f/1.4 maximum aperture is well-suited for working in low-light conditions and also provides greater control over the focus position when using shallow depth of field techniques.Two FLD, five SLD, and two aspherical elements have been incorporated within the lens design to correct for chromatic aberrations throughout the entire focusing range and help to ensure high image sharpness, clarity, and contrast regardless of focus point or aperture setting. This optical design also helps to control distortion and limit vignetting.A Super Multi-Layer Coating has been applied to lens elements in order to minimize lens flare and ghosting and contribute to producing contrast-rich and color-neutral imagery, even in backlit conditions.The integrated HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) realizes quick and quiet autofocusing, which is further complemented by an optimized AF algorithm to produce smoother focusing performance. The HSM also permits full-time manual focus control simply by rotating the focus ring at any time.A rounded nine-blade diaphragm helps to produce an attractive out-of-focus quality.Fixed petal-shaped lens hood helps to reduce lens flare when working in strong lighting conditions and also offers some protection to the front element of the lens.The lens is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite (TSC) material, along with traditional metals, for greater precision and use in wide temperature variations.The bayonet mount is constructed from brass for ensured accuracy and durability.This lens is compatible with the optional Sigma USB Dock for fine-tuning different lens characteristics and updating its firmware.In the Box",899.00,2318450,,

This relatively compact prime telephoto lens will bring all you survey closer to you. Ideal for events where discretion is key, and high-speed is required. A must for events including sports.F-Mount Lens/FX FormatAperture Range: f/4 to f/32One Phase Fresnel ElementOne Extra-Low Dispersion ElementNano Crystal & Super Integrated CoatingsFluorine-Coated Front Lens ElementSilent Wave Motor AF SystemVibration Reduction, Sport/Tripod ModesElectromagnetic Diaphragm MechanismRounded 9-Blade DiaphragmThe power of a Phase Fresnel lens in a revolutionary 300mm.Introducing a thrilling new 300mm f/4 prime lens capable of changing the way pro and serious enthusiasts shoot. At just 147.5mm long and 755g—over 30% shorter and 1.5lbs lighter than its predecessor—the AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR is the world's lightest 300mm full-frame AF lens. (As of January 5, 2015. Statement based on Nikon research.) The secret to its remarkable size? A Nikon-designed Phase Fresnel (PF) lens element, a first for the NIKKOR DSLR lens line-up. But handling isn't the only advantage; the PF element also performs brilliantly—achieve new levels of sharpness and clarity with virtually no chromatic aberration or ghosting. Whether you shoot fashion, portraits, nature, wildlife, sports, action or today's big stories, the AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR will help you capture stunning views of the decisive moment.Thrilling optical performanceThe AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR is a cutting-edge lens engineered to draw peak performance from high-resolution full-frame cameras. The Phase Fresnel element nearly eliminates chromatic aberration on its own. When combined with an Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass element and Nano Crystal Coat (N), it delivers strikingly clear, accurate images. Nikon's Silent Wave Motor (SWM) provides ultra-quiet, ultra-fast autofocusing with seamless manual override (just spin the focusing ring), and a Fluorine coating on the front lens element effectively repels dust, water, grease or dirt, ensuring easy cleaning.Speed, precision and versatilityThe AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR is a quintessential prime lens that belongs in the serious photographer's bag. Its fast f/4 maximum aperture and rounded nine-blade diaphragm produce beautiful bokeh. A highly accurate electromagnetic diaphragm mechanism ensures consistent exposures, especially when shooting at high frame rates. And for greater reach, the AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR is compatible with most Nikon Tele-converters. Work in nearly any light, at any distance, with outstanding sharpness and contrast.4.5 stops of Vibration ReductionThe AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR's Vibration Reduction (VR) feature provides an image stabilizing effect equivalent to a shutter speed increase of 4.5 stops (in NORMAL mode; based on CIPA Standard). Capture sharp, clear handheld images in low light, of fast action and more. VR modes specifically designed for Sports & Action and Tripod Shooting deliver specialized image stabilization to match your situation.A/MA/M stands for Auto-Priority Manual Mode. This mode also enables an easy transition from autofocus to manual during AF operation. However, mode switch sensitivity has been altered to reduce the possibility of sudden unintentional switching to manual focus while shooting.Electromagnetic Diaphragm MechanismAn electromagnetic diaphragm mechanism in the lens barrel provides highly accurate electronic diaphragm or aperture blade control when using auto exposure during continuous shooting. With conventional D/G type lenses, the diaphragm blades are operated by mechanical linkage levers.ED (Extra-Low Dispersion) GlassAn optical glass developed by Nikon that is used with normal optical glass in telephoto lenses to obtain optimum correction of chromatic aberrations.IF LensA NIKKOR lens in which only the internal lens group shifts during focusing. Thus, IF NIKKORS do not change in size during AF operation, allowing for compact, lightweight lenses capable of closer focusing distances. These lenses will be designated with the abbreviation IF on the lens barrel.M/ASelect NIKKOR lenses have a focusing mode which allows switching from automatic to manual focusing with virtually no lag time by simply turning the focusing ring on the lens. This makes it possible to seamlessly switch to fine manual focusing while looking through the viewfinder.Nano Crystal CoatAn anti-reflective coating developed by Nikon that virtually eliminates internal lens element reflections across a wide range of wavelengths. Nano Crystal Coat solves ghost effects caused by red light and effectively reduces ghost and flare caused by light entering the lens diagonally.Phase FresnelPhase Fresnel (PF) lens elements effectively compensate for chromatic aberration and ghosting when combined with ordinary glass lens elements. The PF lens element is based upon the Phase Fresnel lens, which appears to have a series of concentric circles engraved onto it. Utilizing a Phase Fresnel lens element allows Nikon engineers to use fewer lens elements, resulting in a more compact and lightweight lens. Due to the characteristics of a PF (Phase Fresnel) lens that utilizes the photo diffraction phenomenon, when there is a strong light source within the frame or when light enters the lens from outside of the frame, ring-shaped coloured flare may occur according to shooting conditions. This phenomenon can be minimized with “PF Flare Control” to be included in Capture NX-D (ver.1.1.0 or later). For more information, see software Help/manual. Capture NX-D is available from the Nikon website. Be sure to keep your software up to date.Silent Wave MotorAF-S NIKKOR lenses feature Nikon’s Silent Wave Motor (SWM). This technology converts “traveling waves” into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.Super Integrated CoatingNikon Super Integrated Coating is Nikon's term for its multilayer coating of the optical elements in NIKKOR lenses.Vibration ReductionA Nikon in-lens technology that improves image stability by automatically compensating for camera shake. Lenses that offer VR will feature the abbreviation VR on the lens barrel.",1649,677220,,

A pocket fountain pen which everyone could carry anywhere. Just 10.5 cm big when closed, and with the cap on top of the barrel it grew to a standard size pen. Small in the pocket and big in the hand: The Kaweco Sport.Sepp Herberger already appreciated these characteristics.

4560,,Sigma 14mm F1.8 DG HSM Art Lens [Nikon],"Both fast and wide, the Nikon F-mount 14mm f/1.8 DG HSM from Sigma is a unique wide-angle prime designed to produce high-resolution, well-corrected imagery. As part of the Art line of lenses, this lens has a focus on image quality and rendering, and utilizes both FLD and SLD glass elements to control chromatic aberrations and color fringing for notable clarity. Four aspherical elements, including the front large-diameter precision-molded glass element, also contribute to reducing distortion and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness and accuracy. Additionally, a Super Multi-Layer Coating has been applied to individual elements to suppress lens flare and ghosting for greater contrast when working in strong lighting. Well-suited to astrophotography and low-light outdoor shooting, this lens presents a unique blend of a broad perspective and fast, flexible performance.Complementing the optical performance is an equally adept Hyper Sonic Motor, which provides fast, smooth, and near-silent autofocus performance. This focusing motor also enables full-time manual focus override at any time just by rotating the focus ring for refined manual control and focusing as close as 10.6\"". The lens barrel is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite material, which supports working in a wide variety of temperatures and conditions, and the lens mount is constructed from brass for long-term durability and mounting accuracy. Additionally, this lens is also compatible with the optional Sigma USB Dock for fine-tuned control over focusing parameters and other lens characteristics.As part of the Art line within Sigma's Global Vision series, this lens is designed to achieve truly notable optical performance and is ideally suited for creative and artistic applications.Prime wide-angle lens is designed for FX-format Nikon F-mount DSLRs, however it can also be used on DX models where it will provide a 21mm equivalent focal length.Bright f/1.8 maximum aperture is well-suited for working in low and difficult lighting conditions.Three F Low Dispersion (FLD) and four Special Low Dispersion (SLD) elements are featured in the optical design, and help to reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations for improved clarity and color accuracy.Four aspherical elements, including one large, 80mm-diameter precision-molded glass aspherical element, help to minimize distortion and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness.A Super Multi-Layer Coating has been applied to lens elements in order to minimize lens flare and ghosting and contribute to producing contrast-rich and color-neutral imagery, even in backlit conditions.The integrated HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) realizes quick and quiet autofocusing, which is further complemented by an optimized AF algorithm to produce smoother focusing performance. The HSM also permits full-time manual focus control simply by rotating the focus ring at any time.Specialized electromagnetic aperture mechanism provides greater exposure control stability that is especially beneficial when working with fast continuous shooting rates.The lens is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite (TSC) material, along with traditional metals, for greater precision and use in wide temperature variations.The bayonet mount is constructed from brass for ensured accuracy and durability.Additionally, rubber sealing is incorporated in the mount design to render it dust- and splash-resistant.This lens is compatible with the optional Sigma USB Dock for fine-tuning different lens characteristics and updating its firmware.In the Box","1,599.00",2420046,,

4579,masterkeys,*NEW!*Instant info Profits With EBay 2007 - PRIVATE LABEL RIGHTS,"Instant Info Profits With E'bayI guarantee you that you will learn everything you need to know about selling information products on in this ebook! There are literally hundreds of ways you can make money selling information products on E'bay!Date: Wednesday, September 12, 2007From:Dear Friend,Selling information products on the Internet has been one of the biggest boom markets in the last years. You can see that in the number of people selling ebooks, videos, membership sites and so on, on the Internet. Back in the old days ie-1996 there were under 50 people selling information products online, now in 2007, there are literally millions of sites selling all sorts of information to all sorts of people.So why are all these people flocking to sell information products online? Because of the promise of quick money from scam artists. Most people who are selling any sort of information online are usually resellers (affiliates or people who brought reprint rights to a product) or they created an ebook themselves.What these people don't understand is that the market is nearly saturated with the same books they are trying to sell. This of course leads to a price war, and then no one makes any money because they are all trying to undercut themselves to be the cheapest in the market. This is not a viable business idea.\""How to create an automated monthly income selling easy to make information products on !\""I first started selling information products on eBay in 2004, it wasn't a work of art that's for sure. It was a book on how to start your own membership site on a tight budget, which was a hot topic at the time, with many people selling membership scripts and websites on. My first book (that book) only sold for $5.95 and was only 50 odd pages in length, but in 4 weeks I sold 52 copies with my expenses being under $20.So not only did I make close on $500 for a few hours work, I gained a lot new customers to sell other products too. I ended up selling the master reprint rights to that book and sales letter for another $1500.But you don't have to limit yourself to selling ebooks on , there are so many different types of ways to sell your content, it's just a matter of find the right way for you.Audio tapes are a great way to sell products online. All you need is the dubbing equipment and your set. These types of products can sell for over $50. The best way to sell audio tapes is also to send them the tapes transcribed into text so they can read it as well, and this adds more value to the product.If you really want to churn out audio tapes in record time and don't want to do the content yourself, why not hire an expert to talk on the tapes for you?Getting a professional in the field to answer your questions would have to be the simplest ways to create a product. If you were doing a book on direct mail, why not hire a guru for a couple of hours, grill him over the phone or in person, have the conversation taped, and there you go, instant product.Most times people will do interviews with you if you give them the rights to sell the audio tape to their mailing lists. If they won't do this, then all you have to do is hire them for an hour or two, pay their usual consulting fee (a few hundred dollars should do it) and you then have no competition at all.Now I have Released This Guide\""Instant Info Profits From E'bay\""Here's a sample of some of the things you'll learn:1. Why sell Information products2. What type of Products should I create for eBay3. Tools you need to sucead on eBay4. Finding the right eBay category to sell your info product5. Creating your first product to sell on eBayAnd so much more!When you purchase this ebook you will receive full master and public label resell rights Including all the source files,graphics ect ect:\""Okay - So What's The Cost For This Incredible Ebook?\""I was going to sell this package for $47 since most of the products I sell online are either $47 or more to buy and considering the amount of information you will learn, it would be a really fair price.But since I'm not taking on any affiliates to sell this book for me (I don't need them quite frankly) I'm able to sell this package for $9.95A true bargain, if you will.Aside from saving on production and shipping costs, you'll be able to download the ebook and start reading it within 90 seconds! Even sooner if you've got a fast connection.Look at it this way - $9.95 really is a painless drop in the bucket compared to the time and money you'll save yourself from by researching and buying other books. sincerely,FBM marketing *NEW* eBOOK Resale Right Scripts Software DownloadEarn with Resale Rights400+ Items to Resell Online+100 Master Resale Rightshttp://masterkeys.tradebit.comUser tags: ebayebay ebookebay guideinstant info profits with ebay(ID 2156401)",9.95,26152996,USD,wdc_products_additional_rows

4618,Les Jamelles,"Grenache Rouge Vin de France 1,0 l 2019 - Beau Chêne","In the glass, the Grenache Rouge Vin de France from Beau Chêne offers a bright purple-red colour. Ideally poured into a red wine glass, this red wine from the Old World presents wonderfully expressive aromas of blackberry, blackcurrant, mulberry and blueberry, rounded off by cinnamon, black tea and dark chocolate. This dry red wine from Beau Chêne is just the thing for wine connoisseurs who like it absolutely dry. The Grenache Rouge Vin de France already comes quite close to this, as it was pressed with just 5.1 grams of residual sugar. On the tongue, this well-balanced red wine is characterised by an incredibly velvety texture. The Grenache Rouge Vin de France reveals itself on the palate through its present fruit acidity, fantastically fresh and lively. The finale of this red wine from the Languedoc wine-growing region finally convinces with a remarkable aftertaste. Vinification of the Beau Chêne Grenache Rouge Vin de France The balanced Grenache Rouge Vin de France from France is a pure wine, vinified from the Garnacha grape variety. After the grape harvest, the grapes go straight to the press house. Here they are selected and carefully broken up. Fermentation follows in stainless steel tanks at controlled temperatures. Once fermentation is complete, the Grenache Rouge Vin de France can continue to harmonise on the fine lees for a few months. Food recommendation for the Grenache Rouge Vin de France by Beau Chêne Experience this red wine from France ideally tempered at 15 - 18°C as an accompanying wine to leek soup, spinach gratin with almonds or pumpkin casserole.",6.33,1714451,EUR,wdc_products_additional_rows

4653,,BD-Power Torque Converter (Street & Towing) 1070217X,"Built on the premises in a state-of-the-art transmission facility, BD converters feature a heavy duty stamp forged steel cover, much thicker than stock and it is actually stronger than steel billet. BD doubles the amount of lock up clutch material of a stock unit. They furnace braze the turbine and impeller fins to prevent internal leakage, turbine and lock up piston are balanced separately and then as a complete assembly. Turbine to impeller clearance and over all convertor height is verified. Their own cast aluminum stator design maximizes the low-speed torque characteristics of the Cummins engine and BD even has high rpm stall stators for those race applications. The most dependable Torque Converter for stock and mild power on the market today. Street and Towing Applications! In high torque, high-load situations, the torque converter bears the brunt of the engines force. Stock torque converter stator pitch designs slip excessively, causing the oil to foam and ever heat, and the front cover clutch surface to warp. But BDs torque converter was specifically designed to handle the kind of punishment you dish out. On the street, you'll notice that stall speed is reduced significantly, resulting in more positive engagement in drive, enhanced low-speed drivability, less engine rpm and better fuel economy. If you tow or just use a daily driver, you'll appreciate that this model convertor is designed to handle up to 1,000 lb.-ft of torque. It does not have a hard engagement; it is designed for high power towing applications. Features:Heavy Duty Torque ConverterDesigned For Street & Towing ApplicationsEnhanced Low-Speed DrivabilityReduced Stall SpeedHandles 1,000 lb.ft of TorqueWarranty: 36-month / 150,000 mile limited warranty on non competitive, racing or sled-pulling applications.",1010,4687803,USD,wdc_products_additional_rows

4671,,A Guide to Jewish Practice: Volume 3-Life Cycle,"DescriptionJewish life cycle rituals connect participants to the Jewish people and its history. They embody our ancestors’ understanding about God, the world, human relationships and the meaning of life. These rituals persist because they were successful at helping our forebears navigate their pivotal moments. At the same time, we live in a time of rapid change, when some of what we have inherited clashes with our values and our sense of aesthetics. We seek rituals that work for us. Thus, Jewish ritual continues to evolve.Available now, the third volume in A GUIDE TO JEWISH PRACTICE, edited by Rabbi David A. Teutsch, is dedicated to a contemporary understanding of the relevance of rituals. This collection provides thoughtful ways for liberal Jews to think more clearly and knowledgeably about both traditional and adaptive rituals, and to make sound, values-based choices regarding them. Each chapter is devoted to significant rituals surrounding life cycle events, such as welcoming children, bar and bat mitzvah, weddings, divorce, and conversion. An additional chapter explores Jewish ritual across the life cycle, and the final section explores the journey of mourning. According to Rabbi Teutsch, \""The inspiration for this project comes from the many Jewswho want to know how Jewish culture can guide them in arapidly changing world. I believe that can happen only whenwe join one another in a dialogue about how we should liveas Jews. That dialogue, supported by study and shared living, will lead to a vibrant Jewish future.”A Guide to Jewish Practice: Everyday Living, the first volume in the series, won the Myra H. Kraft Memorial Award, the National Jewish Book Award for Contemporary Life and Practice. The second volume, Shabbat and Holidays, opens vistas of meaning and practice that will inspire readers to shape their own approaches to living the cycle of the Jewish year. Taken together, the three volume set is the most comprehensive post-halachic guide ever written and comprises a clear statement of how Jews make decisions about their practice. Rabbi David A. Teutsch is the Louis and Myra Wiener Professor of Contemporary Jewish Civilization; Chair, Department of Contemporary Jewish Civilization; and Director, Levin-Lieber Program in Jewish Ethics at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. He is the author of many books and is the editor in chief of the groundbreaking seven-volumeKol Haneshamah prayer book series.",,74609120,,wdc_products_additional_rows

Frederico Domondon''s debut CD entitled \""Frederico, the Artist\"", embodies a true artist''s passion. Born in Manila, Philippines, Frederico migrated to the U.S. at the age of 16 hoping he would be an artist and a singer someday.In college, he earned an accounting degree and worked as an accountant for ten years due to his mother''s advice.However, in 2000, he was able to quit his day job to pursue his art in Impressionist painting.Then, Frederico had sold over 2,000 of his own paintings from $250 to $20,000 in the last twelve years.Fate smiled at him again when he rediscovered his passion for music when he was hired to perform at a French restaurant in Fremont, California two years ago.His talent for singing, piano playing and composing came back after more than twenty years of non performing since he has been concentrating on being an Artist.And now the dream of coming up with the CD came into fruition.

4698,AdipoGen Life Sciences,Asprosin (human) Matched Pair Detection Set,"Asprosin is a new fasting-induced protein hormone that targets the liver to increase plasma glucose levels. Asprosin is the C-terminal cleavage product of the protein pro-Fibrillin-1. Asprosin is secreted from white adipose tissue and increases hepatic glucose production by using cAMP as a second messenger, leading to activation of protein Kinase A. Reduction of Asprosin levels protects against metabolic syndrome-associated hyperinsulinism. Asprosin may act as a circulating hunger signal. Indeed, peripherally injected recombinant asprosin can cross the blood-brain barrier and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of recombinant asprosin stimulated appetite in wild-type mice, indicating a central mechanism of action. Loss of Asprosin in mice and human leads to decreased fat mass and body weight, and hypophagia. Mice are also completely protected from the development of diet-induced obesity. Asprosin works by stimulating the orexigenic AgRP+ (Agouti related neuropeptide) neurons via a cAMP-dependent pathway and by inhibiting the anorexigenic neurons POMC+ (pro-opiomelanocortin) neurons in a GABA-dependent manner. Mutation in Asprosin in human leads to the pattern of metabolic dysregulation, including partial lipodystrophy, accompanied by reduced plasma insulin. Due to its key role in food regulation, Asprosin function could serve as a potentially unique therapeutic target against obesity, diabetes or metabolic diseases.",750,17640903,CHF,wdc_products_additional_rows

These hippies, with their waist-length hair and handlebar moustaches, long paisley skirts and gumboots, rusted cars and worn sofas, brought with them a Canadian version of the continent-wide back-to-the-land movement, the sexual revolution and the privilege of personal freedom. All Roads Lead to Wells tells the story of these young settlers, their migration, their values, the unexpected friendships forged between the town's old-timers and newcomers and the inevitable clash--occasionally violent--of generations and cultures. Built during the Depression, Wells nearly became a gold-mining ghost town like nearby Barkerville, but thanks to the influence of the \""back-to-the-landers\"" it has evolved into one of BC's renowned arts-based communities.

4765,,Angelica Garcia - WEAR YOUR ROOTS T-SHIRT,"Jcama is about not being seen for having a dual identity. When you dont feel seen, you dont feel accepted for who you are. In my case, Im American, but I am also Mexican & Salvadoran because of my family blood. Though people often dont know where to put me, I proudly wear both sides of my identity. The U.S. is a country made up of people from other countries. This song and video are a love letter to kids who grew up embracing two worlds just like me.Seems like many people in power are concerned with preserving some sort of ideal American identitybut our identity as a country is complex. Accepting and enforcing just one perspective is often just a guise for racism and xenophobia. To knock my family and I down for our Latinx roots is to knock down all of Americas history.LIKE YOU I WAS BORN IN THIS COUNTRY. All proceeds from sales of the Wear Your Roots t-shirt go to regionally-based organizations supporting migrant families in the U.S.: MIRA!, Annunciation House, and Immigrant Families Together.I come from a line of immigrants so I wanted the proceeds of these shirts to go directly towards supporting migrant families. This effort is for the children of the 600 taken by ICE in Mississippi, migrants seeking refuge in El Paso, and families that have been separated at the border.

The combination of these high-quality solid tonewoods and finish produces a beautiful musical sound across the entire tonal range with slightly pronounced lows.• Unique voicing processThe premium nature of Furch Blue CM guitar is underscored by the fact that the soundboard is individually tuned using the voicing process, which enhances the guitar’s tonal properties to the highest level. Thanks to that, Furch Blue CM guitar has a crystalline clear, harmonically rich, balanced, and highly dynamic sound across the entire tonal spectrum.• Open-Pore FinishFurch Blue CM guitar features Open-Pore Finish, a special thin finish that promotes the natural sonic qualities of tonewoods and provides an excellent level of surface protection. The finish accentuates low frequencies and produces a natural woody sound.• Stylish bindingThe guitar owes its attractive natural appearance to binding made from artificial tortoise.• Furch CNR System® Neck DesignA high precision, dual-action truss rod maintains neck stability and allows for fine adjustment of the neck relief, bilaterally.

A highly rigid carbon casing that maintains the neck in the set position over a period much longer than is the case with standard neck joint designs and, at the same time, facilitates a gradual bow in the neck, a factor of essential importance for playability. A casting made of special alloy located inside the neck heel that ensures a stable position of the neck and its angle vis-?-vis the body.• Tortoise pickguardFurch Blue CM guitar is protected by a artificial tortoise pickguard, which has been redesigned by the addition of a transparent extension toward the soundhole. This pickguard shape provides better soundboard protection without disrupting the rosette pattern.• Rosette made from black walnutThe soundhole is adorned by a rosette featuring a double ring with black walnut inlay.• Excellent playabilityThe fingerboard is made from high-quality ebony and features buffed frets, which allows for high playing comfort.",995,57811228,EUR,wdc_products_additional_rows

Ever since I first got in touch with it sometime in the mid '90s, a performance of card magic for me usually involves two decks - one shuffled and one memorized. My first book covered some of my work with the shuffled deck; the time has now come to have a look at the other one. Physics tells us that lifting an object increases its potential energy. Similarly, I like to imagine that every time we arrange our cards in memorized order, we are really charging the pack. In Order to Amaze, then, suggests a number of ways to turn this energy into amazement. The following trick, Catch Me If You Can, is a two-deck, two-phase sandwich routine that contrasts sleight of hand with hands-off test conditions. It also uses a somewhat offbeat method that makes me smile every time I do it.First Look: Patrick Page Audio ArchivePatrick PageWhen Patrick Page died in 2010, he left behind a legacy in magic, including a series of interviews conducted in the UK in 1977. This archive contains over forty hours of largely unreleased interviews with Page's friends, may of whom are magic legends. Patrick's daughter Janette Page says, \""My dad was a great interviewer because of his knowledge of his subjects. They all talk about their careers, the tricks they did, and why. Plus he prods them a bit on personal stuff, too. It is a very large snapshot of a wonderful and fertile period of magic history, and has so many fascinating insights of the greats then, to be heard again now.\"" What follows are brief excerpts from recordings with Jay Marshall, Cy Enfield, and Maurice Fogel.Making Magic: Bank JobMartin LewisBank Job is designed to allow you to easily write a custom presentation tailored for your clients. It's the kind of personal touch that gets you remembered and leads to repeat bookings. The effect has one of my favorite magical moments. Right up to the end, the audience thinks they have the trick figured out. Then you sweep the rug from under their feet - a demonstration of the \""not perfect enough\"" theory in action. Here is my presentation for magicians, in which I poke fun at six of our magical peers. But you can easily customize the effect for any interest group by simply changing a few names.Loving Mentalism: Prediction BackwardsIan RowlandGuest contributor Art Vanderlay has come up with a delightful new twist on standard prediction effects: it's a routine in which you predict the future backwards! More specifically, it's an intriguing and highly entertaining item in which you apparently receive a phone call from yourself in the future, giving you all the information you need to make a successful \""prediction.\"" It sounds weird - and it is - but it takes your audience on a fascinating excursion into temporal paradox. What's more, it's easy to do, and the one thing you need to make it work is free!Bent on Deception: I'm a Loner, Dottie. A Rebel.Mike BentI think my \""Mike Bent: Illusionist\"" phase was a common experience for magicians of my generation. There was so much cool magic going on, and I wanted to be part of it. I think it's the same reason why everyone in a more recent generation wanted to become \""street magicians.\"" Fortunately, I figured out early on that I wasn't cut out to be the next David Copperfield. That harsh realization was softened by a resurgence of comedy magic, fueled by people like Larry Wilson, Harry Anderson, and Penn & Teller. I felt that in them I had found my \""tribe,\"" and I haven't looked back. But every now and then, I do miss one thing from my box-pushing days: assistants.The Monk's Way: Techless Multiplex ResetSteve ReynoldsDeveloping a subtle approach to a Multiple Cards to Pocket, Interchange, Ambidextrous combination sounds improbable. However, by applying the loose tenets of the Monk's Way, I cobbled together the following working model. In this effect, the four Kings and Deuces are shown and signed. The Kings are each placed in four different pockets. One at a time, the Deuces change to Kings. The Deuces are shown in each pocket and replaced. Next, the Kings in your hands change to Deuces, and the Kings are shown in the four pockets. The Kings are then placed on top of the four Deuces. The packet is pressed and the Deuces are shown to have vanished and are removed from the four pockets.For What It's Worth: Eight SecondsMark KornhauserMicrosoft recently released a study intended to make their customers a little more comprehensible to their marketers. In 2000, the average human attention span, they claimed, was twelve seconds. In 2013, the average human attention span was eight seconds. Eight seconds may seem like a lifetime if you are riding a bull, but performers have to think about sixty minutes of riding a bull - so to speak.Walkabout Soup: Advice for Young MagiciansSimon CoronelI recently went to the Magi-Fest convention in Columbus, Ohio, and enjoyed myself. It was a good convention, solidly run and well organized. One thing that particularly impressed me was the level of attention given to encouraging and supporting young magicians. There was an event specifically focused on advice for younger magicians, and a large blank section of wall where experienced magicians were encouraged to write down advice they had for younger ones. Being so busy with other things at the convention, I didn't have time to think about what I wanted to write. Now that I've had more time to chew it over, this is what I would say to",8.00,21485308,SGD,wdc_products_additional_rows

4846,MERGE RECORDS,Fruit Bats - Gold Past Life [LP],"Gold Past Life marks both an end and a beginning for Fruit Bats. It's the end of an unintentional thematic trilogy of records that began with 2014's EDJ (a solo record by name, but a Fruit Bats release in spirit) and hit an emotional peak with 2016's Absolute Loser. They encompassed years of loss, displacement, and the persistent, low-level anxiety of the current political climate. They were written in the wake of friends who left these earthly confines and families that could have been. But these salves, these songs on Gold Past Life, also represent new beginnings-the journeys that await after making it through troubled times. Gold Past Life is about rejecting notions of idealized nostalgia (\""Gold Past Life\"") and the process of grounding oneself in the present, both geographically (\""A Lingering Love,\"" \""Ocean\"") and spiritually (\""Drawn Away\""). With Gold Past Life, Eric Johnson of Fruit B hopes to bring more immediacy to the music and share positivity, hope, and motivation to keep on keepin' on with a wider audience.",9.99,11120487,USD,wdc_products_additional_rows

The old looms on which this wonderful cloth is woven are often still made from wood and are carefully kept in shape by experienced technicians, for no new ones are made.In the heart of the Italian silk industry, Como, lies one of the oldest silk weavers in Europe. Founded in mid-19th-century, at first as a supplier of silk for furnishings and clothing, they began to make silk for ties when it took its modern shape at the beginning of the 20th century. To this day, a lot of historic, wooden looms are in use, which have not been produced in decades. But there is no substitute for them: our popular grenadine silk is woven on them, for example.

He lives with the lovely Parris in Santa Fe, New Mexico.Jacket Description/Back:Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom's protective Wall. To the south, the king's powers are failing: his most trusted advisor dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king's new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards who come together in a time of grim omens. Here, an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal, a tribe of fierce wildings carry men off into madness, a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne, a child is lost in the twilight between life and death, and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.Jacket Description/Flap:Here is the first volume in George R.

Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: thegame of thrones.Marc Notes:Includes two maps covering the territory of A game of thrones on endpapers.Review Quotes:PRAISE FOR GEORGE R. R. MARTIN'S A Game of Thrones \""Grabs hold and won't let go. It's brilliant.\""--Robert Jordan \""Reminiscent of T. H. White's The Once and Future King,this novel is an absorbing combination of the mythic, the sweepingly historical, and the intensely personal.\""--Chicago Sun-TimesA Clash of Kings\""A truly epic fantasy . . . bedazzled by swords and spells wielded to devastating effect . . . a banquet for fantasy lovers with large appetites.\""--Publishers Weekly (starred review) \""Martin amply fulfills the first volume's promise and continues what seems destined to be one of the best fantasy series ever written.\""--The Denver Post\""High fantasy with a vengeance.\""--The San Diego Union-TribuneA Storm of Swords\""George R. R. Martin continues to take epic fantasy to new levels of insight and sophistication, resonant with the turmoils and stress of the world we call our own.\""--Locus\""Riveting . . . a series whose brilliance continues to dazzle.\""--Patriot NewsA Feast for Crows\""Of those who work in the grand epic-fantasy tradition, Martin is by far the best. In fact . . . this is as good a time as any to proclaim him the American Tolkien.\""--Time Publisher Marketing:NOW THE ACCLAIMED HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES--THE MASTERPIECE THAT BECAME A CULTURAL PHENOMENONWinter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.Review Citations:Library Journal Prepub Alert05/01/1996 pg. 80 (EAN9780553103540, Hardcover)Publishers Weekly06/10/1996 pg. 90 (EAN9780553103540, Hardcover) - *Starred ReviewKirkus Reviews07/01/1996 pg. 936 (EAN9780553103540, Hardcover) - *Starred ReviewBooklist08/01/1996 pg. 1889 (EAN9780553103540, Hardcover)Library Journal05/01/1996 (EAN9780553103540, Hardcover)Ingram Paperback Advance07/01/2005 pg. 22 (EAN9780553588484, Mass Market Paperbound)Wilson Fiction Catalog04/11/2019 (EAN9780553381689, Paperback)Beyond the Cover Author Interv10/01/2000 pg. 8 (EAN9780553573404, Mass Market Paperbound)Publishers Weekly07/14/1997 (EAN9780553573404, Mass Market Paperbound)People Weekly05/12/2014 pg. 62 (EAN9780345535528, Boxed Set)Publishers Weekly06/27/2011 (EAN9780307913098, Compact Disc) - *Starred ReviewEntertainment Weekly07/29/2011 pg. 46 (EAN9780553386790, Paperback)Entertainment Weekly07/08/2011 pg. 113 (EAN9780553386790, Paperback)",35.00,1241059,USD,wdc_products_additional_rows

4948,,240 x 485mm Topnotch Stainless Steel BBQ hot plate grill griddle,"DescriptionFeaturesWhether you’re cooking for family, friends, or catering for a function, experience the advantages of healthier cooking, better tasting, restaurant quality food on a Topnotch stainless steel bbq hot plate.What makes a Topnotch bbq plate better than the rest? We use a specific grade of Stainless Steel (3CR12) which features a flat cooking surface, excellent thermal absorption and is extremely corrosion resistant, making it a superior choice for bbq plates when compared to cast iron and regular 304/316 stainless steel bbq hot plates.Cleaning is a breeze due to the completely flat, non-porous cooking surface. This means you’re not going to be mixing those flavours from last night’s Honey Soy Kebabs with tonight’s delicious Atlantic Salmon. Just like each new painting requires a blank canvas, each meal should start with a clean cooking surface to further enhance the flavours of the food being cooked.Cooking temperature, more importantly the consistency of the cooking temperature throughout the bbq plate is a major factor when delivering perfectly cooked food. If you are cooking on a plate with an inconsistent surface temperature, then the taste, quality and appearance of the food will suffer, not to mention your cooking experience. Topnotch has overcome this issue with the use of its specially formulated material which distributes the heat more evenly to give you the best chance of delivering that mouth-watering, memorable meal.Topnotch bbq plates will inspire you to barbeque more often, taking that oily, smokey mess out of the kitchen.Our replacement bbq hot plates are designed and manufactured right here in Australia and have been putting smiles on BBQers faces for or over 20 years.Easy to clean? Absolutely. Our Plates don’t require a coating to prevent them from rusting, this means you can use basically anything to clean them with. Most of the time you can get away with a spatula or a scotch brite pad. If it’s been a while and its heavily soiled with marinades or anything else, you can put it in the dishwasher, or even clean it with a pressure washer.Suitable for Gas bbq’s, wood fired bbq’s, charcoal bbqs, and more.Not limited to just household bbq’s, our plates are also suitable as a commercial hot plate.Select from a wide range of stocked bbq hot plate sizes, and if you still can’t see the size you need, we also manufacture custom made bbq plates of all sizes. For pricing on custom sizes, contact us by either online chat, Email via our contact us page, or give us a call on 02 9604 8699How do I choose the correct product for my barbeque?To find your correct size of replacement cooking surface, simply measure your existing Barbeque Plate and Grill.Once you have established the total cooking surface, you can then decide on your preferred combination. You may like to keep the same size Plate & Grill, or you may want a larger Plate, or larger Grill depending on your cooking needs. You can also divide it into Plate/Grill/Baking dish combination.Cleaning InstructionsYou should clean your Topnotch™ bbq plate after every use.While wearing Long gloves for protection and with the plate at cooking temperature (180 degrees C), pour cold water directly onto the plate. take extreme caution as the water will boil and steam will be produced immediately. Use either a metal spatula or a scouring pad on an extended handle to clean the plate while the water is still boiling, This process can be repeated until the plate is clean.OR,Once cleaned with water and a spatula, allow the plate to cool. You can then give it a thorough clean with a scotch brite pad.Features & SpecificationsFEATURES:Made from Stainless Steel (3CR12 grade)5mm thick materialNo seasoning required.

4949,,A Dog with No Tail,"By: Hamdi Abu GolayyelIn a world with no meaning, meaning is an act . . . This is a story about building things up and knocking them down. Here are the campfire tales of Egypt’s dispossessed and disillusioned, the anti-Arabian Nights. Our narrator, a rural immigrant from the Bedouin villages of the Fayoum, an aspiring novelist and construction laborer of the lowest order, leads us down a fractured path of reminiscence in his quest for purpose and identity in a world where the old orders and traditions are powerless to help. Bawdy and wistful, tragicomic and bitter, his stories loop and repeat, crackling with the frictive energy of colliding worlds and linguistic registers. These are the tales of Cairo’s new Bedouin, men not settled by the state but permanently uprooted by it. Like their lives, their stories are dislocated and unplotted, mapping out their quest for meaning in the very act of placing brick on brick and word on word.",100,61806621,EGP,wdc_products_additional_rows

4976,LaCrosse Boots,LaCrosse Boots: Men's Steel Toe 00101110 EH Puncture-Resistant Rubber Knee Boots,"Stuff on the ground has a way of splashing upward. It's just a natural reaction to impact, like the kind that occurs when you step. And when the stuff on the ground rises up to attack you, protect yourself with the tall safety of these Lacrosse Men's 00101110 Black Premium 16 Inch Waterproof Steel Toe Steel Rubber Boots.These tall, 16-inch shoes are manufactured with waterproof ZXT rubber compound material. The rubber is resistant to ozone and highly durable. It stretches, it flexes, and it moves to match your steps, so it'll protect you the whole time. In addition this ZXT rubber resists tearing and wear. Yellow toe and sole accents and the collars on this men's footwear brighten up the all-black, laceless design. Extra protective rubber toe caps and shovel guards in the arches guard the uppers of this workwear from scuffs and wear. The uppers are also only part of the story of these work shoes. On the bottoms, they're constructed with Trac-Lite outsoles. Constructed for all-around traction on any terrain, the slip-resistant soles help your steps grip and stay steady, no matter where you walk while wearing these rubber boots. The contoured heels of the black shoes prevent slipping and give you a firm, secure fit. The soles are EH rated to give you electrical hazard protection. They’ll absorb electricity, so you can work around open circuits without getting a big shock. These premium shoes are also crafted with non-conductive electrical shock-resistant soles and heels.Remove the insoles of these safety toe boots any time they need to be cleaned. The airy EVA foam cushions and comforts your steps through any tough workday. Meanwhile, fiberglass shanks keep your arches lifted. Well-supported muscles don't have to work and strain so hard, and that keeps your steps more comfortable. The midsoles are designed with steel to protect you from dangerous puncture hazards. The steel helps you stay safer when faced with broken glass, sharp rocks and nails. Along with the steel toes, the midsoles of these puncture-resistant shoes meet or exceed ASTM F2413-11 M I/75 C/75 EH PR safety standards. Last, but not least, the steel toe caps protect the most vulnerable parts of your feet from dangerous impact and compression. Lacrosse Men's 00101110 Black Premium 16-Inch Waterproof Steel Toe Steel Slip-Resistant Boots protect you from stuff that comes above or below - the dangerous stuff you don’t want to deal with.
